<p>A guide for council tenants to safety and security in your home to help avoid accidents that may lead to serious injury or death.</p>

<p>We try to make sure our council properties are as safe as possible. However, you are responsible for your own safety and for anyone living with you.</p>
<h2>Fire Safety</h2>
<p>Fire can be fast spreading, lethal and devastating â yet it is very often preventable. It is important to note that&nbsp;gas bottles and flammable liquids -&nbsp;including petrol -&nbsp;must be kept out of your home.</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="This is an external link to East Sussex Fire Service Fire Safety at Home webpage. You will be leaving our website." href="http://www.esfrs.org/your-safety/fire-safety-at-home/">East Sussex Fire Service: Fire Safety at&nbsp;Home</a></li></ul>
<h2>Electrical Safety</h2>
<p>Have second-hand electrical equipment safety checked before you use it. Always read and follow any instructions provided.</p>
<p>Important: you must not change any part of your home's electrical system without express written permission from us.&nbsp; Your Housing Officer can help.</p>
<p>All electrical work must be carried out by an approved electrician. Donât ignore any electrical faults you notice â deal with them straight away â hot plugs and sockets can electrocute you or start a fire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot solve a problem? <a href="/housing/640.asp" >Report a repair</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h2>Gas Safety</h2>
<p>Gas appliances that are not working correctly can produce poisonous fumes and lead to explosions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.southern-electric.co.uk/HelpAndAdvice/SafetyAndEmergencies/GasSafetyAdvice/" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Southern Electric: Gas Safety Advice</a>&nbsp; </li>
<li><a href="http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/gas/safety" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">National Grid: Emergency Gas Leak Help</a></li></ul>
<p>We are legally obliged to check your gas appliances each year.&nbsp; We will contact you when your annual gas service is due and you must let us into your home to carry this out.</p>
<p>For gas heating problems please call our contractor <strong>BSW Services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During office hours: 01444 836036.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Out of office hours: 07860 524969.</li></ul>
<p>If you live in a flat or bungalow covered by a Scheme Manager, please pull your emergency alarm cord to report faults with your heating.</p>
<h2>Carbon Monoxide Safety</h2>
<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning&nbsp; is rare, but becomes a problem when appliances donât work properly or arenât well ventilated. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/domestic/co.htm" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">HSE: Carbon Monoxide </a></li></ul>
<p>We safeguard tenants by carrying out annual safety checks. We also fit carbon monoxide detectors to properties where the type of gas boiler increases the likelihood of a problem.</p>
<p>DIY gas work is against the law â never try to alter or repair a gas appliance yourself.&nbsp; All work to the gas appliances in your home must be carried out by a <a href="http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Gas Safe registered installer.</a> </p>
<h2>Water Safety</h2>
<p>Make sure you know where your stop tap is. If your water supply is cut off, make sure your taps are closed to prevent flooding and wastage of water when reconnected.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.southeastwater.co.uk/your-water/tips-for-your-home">South East Water: Dealing with drinking water problems</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.southeastwater.co.uk/got-a-question" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">South East Water: I have a question</a>...</li></ul>
<h3>Legionnaires' Disease</h3>
<p>Legionnaires' disease is a form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria. It is contracted through inhaling droplets of water containing the bacteria and can kill. Legionella are bacteria common in hot and cold water systems, storage tanks, pipework, taps and showers.</p>
<p>The risk of Legionella in individual houses or flats is very small. Taking the following advice however, will reduce this even further.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean all taps and shower heads regularly. Unscrew the shower head if it comes apart and clean inside as well </li>
<li>Make sure that lids are kept fitted to water tanks in the loft, and that the tank insulation is not disturbed </li>
<li>If you have&nbsp;a washing machine or dishwasher that is not used or is broken, turn off the water at the&nbsp;valves where the flexible hoses connect to the fixed pipework</li></ul>
<p>When you move into a new home or where your home is left unoccupied for&nbsp;more than&nbsp;1 week, be sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run all showers, baths, wash basin or sinks continuously for a period of 5 minutes to flush through any form of bacteria. <strong>Showers or taps should be opened very slowly to avoid the production of a spray or splashing which could be breathed in</strong> </li>
<li>&nbsp;Switch your water heater 'on' and leave for a period of at least 1 hour prior to use</li></ul>
<p>Those most at risk include elderly people, smokers and those suffering from long-term illness. It is not contracted through drinking contaminated water and cannot be passed from person to person.</p>
<h2>Asbestos Safety</h2>
<p>Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral and has been very widely used in a range of products to improve their strength and durability.&nbsp; It is perfectly safe if it is not disturbed or damaged.&nbsp; If&nbsp;asbestos is to be removed, it will have to be disposed of properly.&nbsp; This may mean using a licensed contractor.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/asbestos-in-home" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Direct.gov: Asbestos removal</a></li></ul>
<h2>DIY Safety</h2>
<p>Over ambition and a lack of knowledge are the two biggest factors in causing death and injury related DIY accidents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be realistic â donât tackle a job unless you really have the ability. Remember, only competent, qualified people should carry out gas or electrical work </li>
<li>Keep tools clean and in good repair and give each one a quick check over before using it </li>
<li>Inspect ladders before each use and make sure that they are extended properly and secured to the building&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>Ensure that all tools are kept safely out of the reach of children </li>
<li>Keep children and pets well away from the work area, particularly when using power tools </li>
<li>Follow the manufacturerâs instructions carefully when using adhesives, particularly the instant type.</li></ul>
<h2>Garden Safety</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wear appropriate shoes when mowing the lawn and keep feet and hands well away from the mower blades </li>
<li>When using an electric hedge trimmer, make sure you keep the cable behind you so that you donât accidentally cut in to it </li>
<li>Turn off and disconnect all electrical appliances before working on them </li>
<li>Ensure that all equipment, paint and chemicals are kept safely out of the reach of children </li>
<li>Keep all products in their original containers </li>
<li>Keep barbecues well away from trees, buildings and fences, and never pour petrol on a barbeque&nbsp; </li>
<li>Keep paths clear and make sure sheds and greenhouses are in good repair so they are not a danger to others.</li></ul>
<h2>Falls In The Home</h2>
<p>The most common accident around the home is a fall. Often it is avoidable. If you notice anything that is faulty or likely to cause you a problem, <a href="/housing/640.asp" >request a repair</a>. </p>
<h2>Safety Alarms</h2>
<p>Pendant alarms, portable alarms worn as a necklace, may be available if you are at risk of falling. <a title="This is an external link to Welbeing lifeline pendant alarm webpage. You will be leaving our website." href="http://www.welbeing.org.uk/who-we-help/older-individuals/">Wealden and Eastbourne Lifeline Services provide a service for our district</a>. <br /></p>
<h2>Neighbourhood Watch</h2>
<p>Neighbourhood Watch groups are made up of local residents who work together to improve the security in the community and help to prevent crime. </p>
<p>If your home is broken into, do not enter if you think the burglars may still be there. <strong>Contact the police immediately</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sussex.police.uk/help-centre/report-something-online" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Sussex Police: Report A Crime Or Incident</a></li></ul>
<h2>Bogus Callers</h2>
<p>Bogus callers will try to talk their way into your home with a variety of stories.&nbsp;Before you open the door to any caller, check to see who it is first by looking through the window or viewer if you have one.</p>
<p>All our staff and anyone working on our behalf will carry identification.&nbsp; Please make sure you have seen this before letting anyone into your home. If you are in any doubt, take the callers name and contact us to check their identity - no one will mind or think you are wasting their time.</p>

<h2>Entry Phone Systems</h2>
<p>If you live in a building with an entry phone system, itâs important that you use it properly to keep the building secure.&nbsp; Do not let in people you donât know or leave the door open after you. </p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>If you have window safety catches, make sure they are secure and working properly - never change or remove them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to avoid putting things under a window that a child could climb on, beds, chairs, boxes and plant pots etc. </li>
<li>Report broken glass immediately </li>
<li>Use the handles to open/close windows â donât push the glass </li>
<li>Proper ventilation is important for your health and safety. </li></ul>
<p>Make sure windows can be opened and <a href="/housing/640.asp" >report faulty windows to us</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to change any windows, glass doors or other glazing, you will need to contact your Housing Officer before stating work.</p>
<h2>Doors and Locks</h2>
<p>Make sure locks and hinges are in good condition. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell everyone in the family where the keys are and keep a spare key in a safe place.&nbsp; There could be a charge if we have to change the lock </li>
<li>Close all doors when you go to bed or go out.&nbsp; This can help prevent the spread of fire </li>
<li>Door stops or a towel over the top of the door will prevent children closing their fingers in it </li>
<li>Fire doors or doors with an entry system must not be propped open </li>
<li>Always use the handles to open or close glazed doors â never push on the glass. </li></ul>
<p>You must get permission from your Housing Officer before altering any doors or door frames to your home.</p>
