                <p><strong>New Council Tax reduction for annexes</strong> - a new 50% reduction from Council Tax has been introduced from 1 April 2014 for annexes which meet one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>The annexe is being used by a resident of the main dwelling as part of their home</li>
<li>The annexe is the sole or main residence of a relative of the person who is liable to pay Council Tax in respect of the main dwelling.</li>
</ul><p>If you think you may qualify for a reduction and would like to apply please email <a href="mailto:council.tax.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">council.tax.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a> or call <strong>01394 444855</strong> for an application form.</p>
            </div>
            
		<p>The full Council Tax bill assumes there are at least two adults living in a  dwelling. If only one adult lives in a property, the Council Tax is reduced by 25%.</p>
<p>People in the following groups may not be liable for Council Tax and may not count towards the number of adults resident in a property:</p>
<ul><li>Full-time students and non-British partners of students, student nurses, apprentices and youth training trainees</li>
<li>Patients resident in a hospital, hospice or care home permanently</li>
<li>People who are severely mentally impaired</li>
<li>People who are staying in certain hostels for the homeless or night shelters</li>
<li>18 and 19 year olds who are at, or have just left school and child benefit is in payment</li>
<li>Certain types of care workers, usually working for charities</li>
<li>People caring for someone with a disability who is not a spouse, partner or child under 18</li>
<li>Members of religious communities</li>
<li>People in prison or other forms of detention</li>
<li>People with diplomatic privilege or immunity</li>
<li>Members and dependants of International Headquarters and Defence Organisations</li>
<li>Members or dependants of visiting forces</li>
</ul><p>If you lose out on a single discount because someone other than a partner  living in your home is not listed above, but is on a low income, you may qualify  for a <a href="/yourhome/benefits/claim/#rebate">second adult rebate</a>.</p>
<h2>Second homes</h2>
<p>Second homes are properties that are furnished but where no one lives in them as their main residence. From 1 April 2013 <strong>no discount</strong> is granted in respect of properties in this category unless the dwelling is a caravan, mooring occupied by a boat, or the liable person has to live in job-related accommodation as part of their job. In these cases a 50% discount would apply. <a href="/yourhome/counciltax/exemptions/changes/">More about changes to charges for second homes from 1 April 2013</a>.</p>
<h2>Empty properties</h2>
<p>Empty properties are defined as those which are unoccupied and unfurnished. Following vacation there will be a 25% discount for the first three months followed by a full 100% charge for up to 24 months. If a property remains empty after two years a premium of 50% will be payable in addition to the full charge. <a href="/yourhome/counciltax/exemptions/changes/">More about changes to charges for empty properties from 1 April 2013</a>.</p>
<p>However a premium will not apply to a dwelling which would be the sole or main residence of a person, but which is empty while that person lives in accommodation provided by the Ministry of Defence by reason of their employment.</p>
<p>Billing authorities will also be prevented from charging an empty homes premium in relation to dwellings which form annexes in a property which are being used as part of the main residence or dwelling in that property.</p>
<p>If the owner of a house has died, Council Tax isn’t charged for up to 6 months after probate is granted.</p>
<h2>Dwellings undergoing major repair or structural alteration</h2>
<p>Properties which become unoccupied and unfurnished and require or are undergoing major repair or structural alteration will qualify for a discount of 25% for up to a year or until they become occupied, furnished or six months have elapsed since completion of works, whichever occurs first. <a href="/yourhome/counciltax/exemptions/changes/">More about changes to charges for dwellings undergoing major repair or structural alteration from 1 April 2013</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that these are broad descriptions</strong> - full legal  definitions can be obtained by contacting the Council Tax team on <strong>01394  444855</strong> or email <a href="mailto:council.tax.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">council.tax.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Applying for a discount</h2>
<p>If you consider you may be entitled to a discount from your bill please contact us on <strong>01394 444855</strong> or email <a href="mailto:council.tax.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">council.tax.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a> for an application form. You can apply for some discounts by <a href="/yourhome/counciltax/onlineforms/">completing an online form</a>.<br><br>If we decide that you are not  entitled to a discount and you believe you are you have the right of  appeal. Firstly you must write to us stating the reasons why you think you  should be granted a discount. We then have two months to reply. If you still  disagree with our decision then have the right to <a href="/yourhome/counciltax/appeals/">appeal to the Valuation Tribunal</a>. In the meantime you should continue to pay your  bill.</p>
<p>If you are granted a discount which you realise should not apply you must contact us immediately otherwise you may face a penalty.</p>
