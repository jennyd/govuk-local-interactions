	<h1>Requesting an assessment</h1>
</div>
							<div class="content-wrap">
								<p>If you think you need some support to manage day-to-day tasks, it can be useful to talk through your situation with someone who can look at the difficulties you're experiencing and who can offer suggestions and advice that will help make things easier. This process is called an assessment.</p>
<p>Different organisations can help with assessments. You can ask for an assessment from your local council, or you can approach a private assessment agency. In some cases independent community organisations offer advice and guidance on assessments as well.</p>
<h3>An assessment from the council</h3>
<p>You can apply to have your needs assessed for free through your local council. Under <a href="/money-and-legal/legal/care-act-2014/" title="Care Act 2014">law</a> you have a right to be assessed for care by your local council if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you appear to have care and support needs</li>
<li>you are caring for someone with care and support needs</li>
<li>you already have help from the council but you think your needs have changed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can approach your council yourself, or be referred by someone you know, or by a professional who is already involved in your care, such as a GP, community nurse, or mental health nurse.</p>
<p>If you're being referred by someone else, that person should have discussed and agreed this in advance with you.</p>
<p>Depending on where you live, the council may ask you to complete a form or questionnaire so that they can understand more about your needs and your living situation before they meet you. </p>
<p>A social worker will meet with you and talk to you about your situation. This is known as the assessment (see further down this page for information on what to expect as part of the assessment). </p>
<p>Following the assessment, and depending on your situation, you may be asked to go through a short period of <a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/regaining-your-independence/" title="Regaining your independence">rehabilitation or reablement</a> (usually within your own home). The aim of this is to see if you can regain the ability to do some of those things which you have been finding difficult, before a final decision is made on what support you'll need.</p>
<p>A decision will then be made about whether you're eligible for support (see below for information on how this is decided). If you are eligible, the social worker will start putting together a plan with you to meet your needs. This is called a 'support plan'.</p>
<p>If you're not eligible for support from the council, the social worker will suggest other support options for you and will make sure that you're able to make any necessary arrangements.</p>
<h4>What to expect at your assessment</h4>
<p>If you have an assessment you can expect that whoever carries it out will:</p>
<ul>
<li>clearly explain the assessment process from the start, and what your options are at each stage of the process</li>
<li>make sure that you take part in the assessment as much as possible and give your own views about what you need and what is important in your life</li>
<li>offer you an interpreter or an advocate (someone who can speak on your behalf) if you need help to communicate your views</li>
<li>arrange some temporary support for you whilst your assessment is being completed, if you have a serious or immediate need</li>
<li>involve other professionals and specialists (such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists) in your assessment if needed. If they do this they'll tell you who they intend to consult and check that you're happy for them to do this</li>
<li>if someone looks after you, offer a <a href="/looking-after-someone/carer-benefits/carers-assessment/" title="Carer's assessment">carer's assessment</a> to that person</li>
<li>give you a copy of your completed assessment and a statement of needs which will tell you whether you're eligible for support from the council or not</li>
<li>try to give you information and advice about other services more suitable for your needs if you're not eligible for help</li>
</ul>
<h4>How the council decides if you're eligible to receive support</h4>
<p>A council decides who will be eligible using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/366104/43380_23902777_Care_Act_Book.pdf" target="_blank" title="Link to assessment national eligibililty criteria for support from the council">the national eligibility criteria which can be found here</a>. This all contains information about carers and charging for services which you may find helpful.</p>
<h4>If you're eligible for support, how will it be provided?</h4>
<p>The support you may receive will depend upon your specific circumstances. This support may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/equipment-to-help-at-home/" title="Equipment to help at home">equipment</a> to help you stay independent</li>
<li><a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/technology-for-independent-living/" title="Gadgets to help you stay safe">gadgets to keep you safe in your home</a></li>
<li><a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/support-in-your-home/" title="Support in your home">help looking after yourself at home</a><a href="file:///C:/Users/richard.biscoe/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/WTOPMDZQ/P155_At%20home_Requesting%20an%20Assessment%20RW.docx#_msocom_5"></a></li>
<li><a href="/going-out/" title="Going out">help with going out </a></li>
<li>help with gaining <a href="/work-and-learning/finding-work/" title="Finding work">employment </a>or accessing <a href="/work-and-learning/education/" title="Education">education</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you're eligible for support you'll be allocated a <a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/personal-budgets-direct-payments/" title="Personal Budgets &amp; Direct Payments">personal budget</a> to cover the cost of this support. From this personal budget you may then receive a sum of money, known as a <a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/personal-budgets-direct-payments/" title="Personal Budgets &amp; Direct Payments">direct payment</a>, which you can use to arrange and pay for the support yourself. Alternatively, the council can use your personal budget to arrange the support on your behalf.</p>
<p>However you receive your support, a social worker can work with you to draw up a written support plan which gives details of how your support will be provided, how much it costs, and who'll be paying for it. This gives you the chance to take control, decide how you'll receive your support, and get a clear idea of when and how this support will be provided.</p>
<p>Our page on <a href="/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/personal-budgets-direct-payments/" title="Personal Budgets &amp; Direct Payments">Personal Budgets and Direct Payments</a> will tell you more about how your support plan is drawn up.</p>
<h4>Paying towards your support</h4>
<p>Depending on your financial situation, you may be asked to pay towards the cost of the support which your council helps you to arrange. You'll be asked to complete a <a href="/money-and-legal/paying-for-support/paying-towards-council-support-at-home/" title="Paying towards council support at home">financial assessment</a> so that the council can decide how much you should be asked to pay.</p>
<h4>If your needs change or your care isn't working out</h4>
<p>Your local council will arrange for a social worker or another health and social care worker to review your support plan from time to time to make sure it still fits your needs. If anything changes, for example if your health worsens, or you have a fall, or you move house, it's a good idea to let your social worker know as soon as possible so that they can make any adjustments to your support plan and see if there are any ways to help you regain your independence. </p>
<p>And if there is a problem with the way your care is being provided (perhaps a care worker is not doing all the things listed in your support plan), and you can't get the problem sorted by yourself, then <a href="http://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Contact-us.aspx" title="Essex County Council - Contact Us">contact your council</a> and ask them to help out.</p>
<h4>What to do if you're refused an assessment</h4>
<p>Most people who ask for an assessment for care services will receive one. However, the local authority can refuse to carry out an assessment if they feel there is not a genuine need for support.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you're refused an assessment and you're unhappy with the council's decision, you should first of all write to them formally to request an assessment, state your case, and ask the council to provide written reasons as to why it's unwilling to carry out an assessment. Make sure your council is fully aware of your situation, and give any relevant details, for example about any disabilities or health problems.</p>
<p>If you're still not happy with the council's decision, you're entitled to <a href="/your-voice/complaints-and-feedback-to-your-council/" title="Complaints and feedback to your council">make a formal complaint through the complaints procedure</a>.</p>
<h4>Contacting your local council to request an assessment</h4>
<p>To request an assessment please call Essex County Council <em>Adult Social Care</em> on: 0345 603 7630.</p>
<h3>Private and independent assessments</h3>
<p>You may prefer not to approach your local council about an assessment. In particular, if you're likely to be asked to pay the full cost for your care by the council following a <a href="/money-and-legal/paying-for-support/paying-towards-council-support-at-home/" title="Paying towards council support at home">financial assessment</a> then you may feel that it would be simpler to make your own arrangements.</p>
<p>A number of independent organisations and charities, as well as private individuals, can help you to carry out an assessment of your care needs, offer advice and guidance on the assessment process, and assist you to arrange the best support once an assessment is completed.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.basw.co.uk/">The British Association of Social Workers</a></em> can provide information about private social workers.</p>
<p>Please note that these private and voluntary organisations are not affiliated with your local council and they may charge for their service.</p>
