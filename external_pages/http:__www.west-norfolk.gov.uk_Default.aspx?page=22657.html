<p><strong>Brancaster Neighbourhood Development Plan</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Publication for Comment &ndash; Closed 4 June
2015</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brancaster Parish Council has prepared a proposed Neighbourhood
Development Plan to shape development in the Parish over the coming
years.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was published for 6 weeks for
comment.&nbsp; The consultation period closed on&nbsp;4 June
2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The comments received will be used to help an independent
examiner and the Borough Council to decide whether the proposed
neighbourhood plan meets the statutory tests, and can therefore
proceed towards a local referendum on whether it should come into
force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tests it must meet are (summarised):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports sustainable development;</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General conformity with the strategic
policies in the Borough Local Plan;</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has regard to the National planning
Policy framework; and</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complies with EU rules on e.g.
protection of wildlife/habitats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed neighbourhood development plan covers the whole of
Brancaster Parish, and the period until 2026.&nbsp; If it is judged
to meet the statutory tests and successfully passes a local
referendum it will become part of the development plan for the area
(alongside the Local Plan), and be used to guide development in the
area and determine applications for planning permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can view&nbsp;the proposed neighbourhood plan via the

<p><strong>Confirmation of byelaws - acupuncture, tattooing,
semi-permanent skin colouring, cosmetic piercing and
electrolysis.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The borough council is considering introducing a new Tattoo
Hygiene Rating Scheme.&nbsp; Before it can do so, it needed to have
in place byelaws that set out the standards of hygiene expected at
premises and by practitioners who may wish to participate in the
new rating scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These byelaws have been produced and have been agreed by the
council's cabinet.&nbsp; They&nbsp;now need to be confirmed by the
Secretary of State.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People were invited to send
object to the Secretary of Station by 2nd June.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The byelaws can be viewed on our <a href="Default.aspx?page=26328">Special
Treatments and Skin Piercing</a> page.</p>

<h4><strong>Community Infrastructure Levy</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consultation on a preliminary draft charging schedule should the
council decide to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levy closed
on 27 February 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Community Infrastructure Levy came into force in April 2010
allowing local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from
developers undertaking new building projects to help lever in
investment for a wide range of infrastructure needed to support
such developments. Whilst the Levy would not necessarily pay for
everything required, it would help ensure that growth in the area
would be achieved through planned and carefully considered
development with the right infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details of the draft charging schedule, along with supporting
documents including a list of potential projects that could be
funded from the collected levy is available on our Local
Development Framework pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, following this consultation, the council decides to
introduce a levy, a further draft document would need to be drawn
up for examination by the Planning Inspector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other ways to have your say</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to our published consultations, you can
also&nbsp;have your say in the following ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>West Norfolk Quality of Life Survey</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every two years the West Norfolk Partnership (of which&nbsp;we
are&nbsp;a Partner) carries out an in depth face to face survey
with nearly 3,000 residents across the borough. The survey asks
residents about their views in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>local issues and priorities for the neighbourhood</li>
<li>perceptions of crime</li>
<li>access to social activities</li>
<li>health</li>
<li>aspirations</li>
<li>sense of belonging</li>
<li>levels and community involvement</li>
<li>pride</li>
<li>quality of life</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the survey are used to inform future actions and
ensure resources are focused on those things that can really help
people feel better about where they live.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Focus groups and forums</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time, we undertake service specific focus groups,
surveys, forums and workshops. These are by invitation or are
publicised in the local media and on our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Safer Neighbourhood Action Panels (SNAPs)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are working in partnership with the Police, West Norfolk
Partnership and other local agencies where you live to identify and
address community concerns. SNAP meetings give you the chance to
get more involved and have greater say over what happens in your
area by discussing issues at a local level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel will be made up of representatives from the Council,
Police and other community representatives. As a member of the
public you are able to raise any issues of concern in your
neighbourhood.</p>

<h3><strong>Become a Councillor</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In becoming a borough councillor you can represent the views of
your constituents and help them resolve issues they have. It is an
opportunity to influence priorities and support the people you

<p>Parish and town councils have a large range of powers, and the
activities&nbsp;they are involved in are wide ranging. Many parish
and town councils are involved in planning, promoting tourism,
licensing, community halls, representation, management of town and
village centres and providing community halls and by becoming a
parish councillor you can have an influence on some of these
things.</p>
