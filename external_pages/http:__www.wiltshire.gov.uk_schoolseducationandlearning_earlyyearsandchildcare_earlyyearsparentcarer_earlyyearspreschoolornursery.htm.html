		<h3>Pre-schools</h3>
<p>Pre-schools offer sessions of care, play and education for children between 2 and 
5 years of age. Groups are usually open in term time only, and for between 4 and 10 sessions a week. 
Working parents can combine a childminder and a pre-school group to provide childcare throughout the 
day. Increasingly lunch clubs and extended hours are offered by pre-schools.</p>
<p>Some advantages:</p>
<ul><li>can be easier to combine with alternative care such as a childminder</li><li>opportunity 
to get involved as a parent</li><li>always staff to cover if one carer is sick</li></ul><p>Some 
disadvantages:</p>
<ul><li>need to find alternative care in the school holidays</li><li>only 
admit children from about 2 years of age</li><li>needs to be combined with alternative care 
if working hours exceed group sessions</li></ul><h3>Nurseries</h3>
<p>Nurseries usually offer full day-care, play and education between 8am and 6pm all 
year round. Nurseries cater for a wider range of children, often including babies.</p>
<p>Some advantages:</p>
<ul><li>group setting where the majority of staff are trained in childcare</li><li>always 
staff to cover if one carer is sick</li><li>open 50 weeks of the year with full and part-time 
places</li></ul><p>Some disadvantages:</p>
<ul><li>may not take and collect older children from school</li><li>can 
be difficult to negotiate flexible hours</li><li>can be expensive, particularly for babies</li></ul><h3>How 
do I make a choice?</h3>
<p>The best way to decide whether a pre-school or nursery is right for your child is 
to visit while other children are there, taking your child with you.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to talk to other parents and find out why they chose to send 
their child to a particular group.</p>
<p>Questions you might wish to ask include:</p>
<ul><li>How will my child be settled into the group?</li><li>How is good 
behaviour encouraged, and how are behaviour problems dealt with?</li><li>How will you report 
to me on my child's progress?</li><li>Will I be able to see and discuss records kept about 
my child?</li><li>What activities might my child do in a typical session/day?</li><li>Is 
there a waiting list?</li><li>Can I see your most recent Ofsted report?</li><li>What 
experience and/or training do the staff have? (Including training in baby care if this is significant.)</li><li>What 
is the fee structure?</li></ul><p>Things to look for might include:</p>
<ul><li>Are the adults welcoming? </li><li>Are the children happy and 
involved in what they are doing? </li><li>Are the toilets nearby and easy for the children 
to use on their own? </li><li>How are rest periods planned into the session/day? </li><li>Do 
the adults speak calmly, and give positive encouragement? </li><li>How much choice do the 
children have about their activities? </li><li>Is it an exciting environment? </li><li>Is 
there a wide range of resources e.g. books, natural materials, table top and floor games, art and craft 
resources, climbing equipment and imaginative play areas? </li><li>Are the resources in good 
condition? </li><li>Is there an outside play area and equipment? </li><li>How 
much time do the children spend outside? </li></ul><h3>How much do they charge?</h3>
<p>There is no standard fee structure.</p>
<p>Pre-schools and nurseries set their own rates and you should always be clear about 
their charges. Nursery charges will be partly dependent on the age of the child with a full time place 
costing around &#163;30 per day. Fees for babies are always higher due to the need for a higher staff to 
child ratio. Pre-school sessions usually cost between &#163;6.50 and &#163;9.00.</p>
<h3>Can I get help with the fees?</h3>
<p>Pre-schools and nurseries set their own fee structures with different rates depending 
on the child's age and the length of time they are in the setting. </p>
<p>Support for the cost of care and education of young children may be available through:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.taxcredits.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/" target="_self">The childcare element of Working Tax Credit</a> - lone parents 
and couples who both work 16 hours or more a week may be entitled to the childcare element of Working 
Tax Credit which can pay up to 70% of childcare costs.</li><li>Childcare vouchers (in exchange 
for a salary sacrifice) - one or both parents could receive childcare vouchers in lieu of some of their 
salary to help pay for the cost of childcare</li><li><a href="schoolseducationandlearning/earlyyearsandchildcare/earlyyearschildcareprofessionals/freenurseryentitlement.htm">Free entitlement funding</a>- 
from the term following their 3rd birthday all children can receive 15 hours of free entitlement per 
week (to a maximum of 570 hours in a year) in a pre-school or nursery. There is also funding available 
for some <a href="schoolseducationandlearning/earlyyearsandchildcare/earlyyearschildcareprofessionals/freenurseryentitlement/twoyearoldfunding.htm">2 year olds</a>.</li><li>Inclusion funding - various funding streams 
are available for fees and additional support to enable children with additional needs to attend pre-school 
or nursery. Ring Wiltshire's Childcare Helpline on 0300 003 4561 for more information.</li></ul><h3>Nursery 
classes</h3>
<p>Nursery classes are attached to some Wiltshire primary and infant schools. The classes 
cater for 3 and 4 year olds for a minimum of five half-day sessions per week in term time. Some independent 
schools offer classes for 3 and 4 year olds.</p>
<p>Some advantages: </p>
<ul><li>can provide free early years education for 3 and 4 year olds in some infant 
and primary schools; however, fees are charged by independent schools</li><li>always staff 
to cover in case of sickness</li><li>at least one member of staff is a qualified teacher.</li></ul><p>Some 
disadvantages: </p>
<ul><li>children can only attend for five mornings or afternoons during school terms</li><li>children 
are not guaranteed a place in the infant or primary school</li><li>needs to be combined with 
alternative childcare if working hours exceed opening times.</li></ul><p>In all settings 
each child in a group will have their own keyworker and each group will have a SENCO (Special Educational 
Needs Co-ordinator).</p>
<p>Nursery classes are free in state schools; independent schools set their own charges 
although <a href="schoolseducationandlearning/earlyyearsandchildcare/earlyyearschildcareprofessionals/freenurseryentitlement.htm">free entitlement hours</a> are available in most independent schools for eligible 
children.</p>
<h3>What happens if my child is ill or has an accident?</h3>
<p>Caring for sick children is not part of a pre-school or nursery&#8217;s role, and you 
should keep your child at home or collect them if they are unwell. </p>
<p>In the case of an accident the needs of the child should be put first, and action 
taken accordingly.</p>
<p>You will already have been asked to sign a consent form allowing the group to seek 
emergency treatment if necessary. You will also be asked to sign the group's accident/incident book 
confirming that you were given full details of any accident and the action that was taken.</p>
