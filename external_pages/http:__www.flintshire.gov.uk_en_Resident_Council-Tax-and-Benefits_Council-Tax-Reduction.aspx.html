<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>If you are responsible for paying the Council Tax and you are on a low income, you may be able to get help with some or all of your Council Tax bill.</p>
<p><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></p>
<p>You may get Council Tax Reduction if you pay Council Tax and your income and capital (savings and investments) are below a certain level.</p>
<p>To work out your Council Tax Reduction, we will look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>money you and your partner or civil partner have coming in, including earnings, some benefits and tax credits and things like occupational pensions</li>
<li>your savings and your partner's or civil partner's savings</li>
<li>your circumstances: for example your age, the size of your family and their ages, if you or any of your family are disabled, and if anyone who lives with you could help with the Council Tax</li>
</ul>
<p>The most Council Tax Reduction you can get is 100 per cent reduction on your bill.</p>
<p>If you're entitled to Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or the 'guarantee credit' of Pension Credit you could get maximum help with your Council Tax.</p>
<p><strong>Who isn't eligible?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have savings of over &pound;16,000 you can't normally get Council Tax Reduction, unless you're aged 60 or over and getting the 'guarantee credit' of Pension Credit.</li>
<li>Most asylum seekers and people sponsored to be in the UK won't get Council Tax Reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>To see if you can get any help and for an estimate of your entitlement you can use our <a title="Information on: benefits calculator" class="sys_16" href="https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf">benefits calculator</a>. &nbsp;(Please note, all our forms are compatible with Internet Explorer and Safari, however you may experience issues when using other browsers).</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="#">How to Claim</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>There is one claim form to complete and you are assessed for both Housing Benefit and Council Tax Reduction at the same time.</p>
<p>If you are claiming for an address in Flintshire, then the form, together with any evidence to support your claim will need to be returned to us. &nbsp;As benefit cannot normally be backdated, you should make your claim as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You can use our on-line <a title="Housing Benefit &amp; Council Tax Benefit, benefits calculator" class="sys_16" href="https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf">&lsquo;Benefits Calculator&rsquo;</a> to see if you qualify. &nbsp;(Please note, all our forms are compatible with Internet Explorer and Safari, however you may experience issues when using other browsers). &nbsp;If you have capital of &pound;16,000 or more you will not be entitled to benefit unless you are getting &lsquo;Guaranteed Pension Credit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you have recently made a claim for Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance, Pension Credit or Employment and Support Allowance, your claim form for Housing and Council Tax Reduction will usually be completed for you by the Department for Work and Pensions and sent directly to us.</p>

<p>&bull; When completed, you can submit the form directly to our server so we can begin processing your claim without delay.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="#">Changes in your circumstances</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p><strong>What do I do if my circumstances change?</strong></p>
<p>You must tell us straightaway about any change in your circumstances. It is your responsibility to let us know of any changes that may affect the amount of benefit you get.</p>
<p>If you do not tell us straight away we may pay you too much benefit, and you will have to pay back the overpayment. Even if you have told another agency, such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or Pension Service, you must still tell us.</p>
<p>If the change means that you are entitled to more benefit and you do not tell us within one month of the change happening, you may lose benefit.</p>
<p>You may be prosecuted if you deliberately give us false information or fail to tell us of a change in your circumstances in order to get more benefit than you have a right to receive.</p>
<p><strong>What type of changes must I tell you about?</strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples of changes affecting you, your partner or a member of your household which you need to tell us about:</p>
<p>&bull; Wages, pensions or benefits go up or down</p>
<p>&bull; Any other change in your income</p>
<p>&bull; Start or stop work</p>
<p>&bull; Change jobs</p>
<p>&bull; Start to get or no longer get any State Benefit</p>
<p>&bull; Savings going up or down, unless they remain less than &pound;6,000 (or less than &pound;10,000 for pensioners aged 60+)</p>
<p>&bull; If the amount of your savings goes over &pound;16,000</p>
<p>&bull; How many people live with you</p>
<p>&bull; Any of your children leaving school</p>
<p>&bull; If you stop receiving Child Benefit for a child</p>
<p>&bull; Moving home (even if you move to another flat or room at the same address)</p>
<p>&bull; Birth of a baby</p>
<p>&bull; Going into hospital or a residential / nursing home</p>
<p>&bull; A change in the amount of rent your landlord charges you</p>
<p>Please note;</p>
<p>This is not a full list and if you are unsure whether a change in your circumstances will affect your benefit please contact us for further advice.</p>
<p><strong>Remember - If in doubt, tell us about it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I report a change?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is it secure?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. &nbsp;To ensure that no-body can read the information you send us we have taken the following measures:</p>
<p><strong>Encryption technologyOur secure server software encrypts all your personal information.

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="#">Benefit Fraud</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>Flintshire County Council wants everyone who is entitled to claim benefits to apply for them, but stop those who steal from the system. &nbsp;Fraud has an impact on the amount of Council Tax and income tax you pay and the amount of resources available to the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits are for the needy - not the greedy.</li>
<li>Benefit fraud is theft from everyone, taxpayers and non-tax payers alike. It's theft from those entitled to benefits.</li>
<li>Benefit fraud is not just the Government's business - it's everybody's business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flintshire County Council is committed to protecting public funds through action against benefit fraud and anyone who cheats the benefit system will not be allowed to get away with it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Benefit Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Benefit fraud is where people claim a benefit including Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support they are not entitled to by giving false information or not telling us when their circumstances change.</p>
<p>People who deliberately claim benefit when they are not entitled to it are committing a criminal offence.</p>
<p>Any person who makes a false statement or produces a false document in order to obtain benefit is committing a criminal offence that is punishable</p>
<p>Any person who fails to notify the Council of a change of circumstances in order to continue to receive benefit is committing a criminal offence that is punishable</p>
<p>Flintshire County Council are anxious to ensure that people who are entitled to benefits receive all the help they need.</p>
<p>We do however consider Benefit Fraud to be a serious offence against not only the Council and the Government, but against society as a whole, for this reason we are seriously committed to tackling the issue of Benefit fraud in a professional manner , working to guidelines and legislation laid by the Government</p>
<p>Money lost to Benefit cheats is money that is supposed to be spent on you and on services provided by the Council.</p>
<p>Benefit fraud is a criminal offence involving false claims for Benefits such as Housing Benefit and Income Support. It is a major part of organised crime today.</p>
<p><strong>How to report suspicions of fraud</strong></p>
