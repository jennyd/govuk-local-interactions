<div>
<p>Fleas are found in dwellings where pets are kept or in areas where feral cats live.</p>
<p>The adults are 2-3mm long, red to brown in colour, with flattened bodies.</p>
<p>Adult fleas are stimulated by vibrations and carbon dioxide production. This is why hordes of fleas sometimes attack people entering houses which have been empty for a long time.</p>
<p>Fleas act as a host of the dog tapeworm which can also infect humans.</p>

<div>
<p>Moles can be found wherever there is suitable soil for tunnelling. They usually avoid soil that is shallow, stony, waterlogged or acidic.</p>
<p>They are usually active just after sunrise and just before sunset. Moles damage plants by tunnelling, deface grasslands and gardens with their molehill, and can also cause silage crops to be spoiled.</p>
<p>When you contact us regarding a problem with moles, an estimate of the scale ofÂ the moleÂ infestation will establish the cost of treatment. After this, a pest control officer willÂ call youÂ to arrange an appointment.</p>

<div>
<p>Rats breed rapidly, are very adaptable and highly mobile. This combination can make rat control a difficult task for the untrained individual.</p>
<p>Mice can at times be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin" title="Vermin">vermin</a>, damaging and eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crops" title="Crops">crops</a>, causing structural damage and spreading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease" title="Disease">diseases</a> through their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite" title="Parasite">parasites</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">faeces</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the traps available on the commercial market are unsafe to use in buildings where children live or study.Â  Our officers use bait boxes which are specially designed to entice rats or mice inside whiles ensuring none of the bait falls out. The bait used is in blocks which are wired inside the box in separate compartments. The boxes are also designed to ensure they cannot be opened by children or other animals.</p>

<h3><a name="bats"></a>Bats</h3>
<p>All bats in the UK are protected due to their declining numbers. If you have problems with bats, contact theÂ <a href="http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/help.html">Bat Conservation Trust</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="foxes"></a>Foxes</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that foxes can cause considerable nuisance. However, many people enjoy the experience of encountering the urban fox, even to the extent of deliberately feeding and encouraging them.</p>
<p>Foxes can carry fleas and internal parasites such as worms, but there is little evidence that these can be passed on to humans or their pets. Foxes also carry toxocara, a disease which can also be carried by domestic dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Like most local councils, we do not control the fox population, as it is expensive and often counterproductive. More foxes do not breed each year and killing foxes can actually upset breeding patterns, leading to increased activity and disruption.</p>
<p>To reduce fox activity on your property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your rubbish in bins until the day of collection wherever practical</li>
<li>Make sure your bins have secured lids</li>
<li>Use special bird feeders rather than putting food on the floor</li>
<li>Do not feed your dogs and cats out of doors</li>
<li>Do not use bone meal fertilisers in the garden</li>
<li>Use an appropriate repellent from a DIY store</li>
<li>If you keep smaller pets in your garden, ensure they have strong cages</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="squirrels"></a>Grey squirrels</h3>
<p>To eradicate grey squirrels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a squirrel proof bird feeder</li>
<li>A pest control company may help you squirrel proof your property and neighbouring trees</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="pigeons"></a>PigeonsÂ </h3>
<p>Pigeons are a common sight in urban environments, and may also be found on farms. To deal with pigeons, take away the food source and pigeon proof the building to prevent entry. Whilst we will not eradicate pigeons, we can proof buildings/areas where pigeons roost. Free quotes are available.</p>

<h3>Gulls in Herefordshire</h3>
<p>Over the past 20 years, seagulls have moved inland to nest. In 2009, it was estimated that Hereford had approximately 400-500 breeding pairs of seagulls - specifically herring gulls and lesser black backed gulls.</p>
<p>The gulls mainly nest on the flat roofed factories in the north of Hereford city and in Rotherwas, although colonies have also spread to some of the city centre shops, houses and hotels. Commonly cited problems include:Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Noise caused by calling gulls and by their heavy footsteps</li>
<li>Mess caused by their droppings, fouling on washing, gardens and people</li>
<li>Damage to property, caused by gulls picking at roofing materials and by nests which block gutters or hold moisture against the building structure</li>
<li>Diving and swooping on people and pets. This usually occurs when chicks have fallen from a nest</li>
<li>Blockage of gas flues by nesting materials. This can have serious consequences if gas fumes are prevented from venting properlyÂ </li>
</ul>
<h3>Legislation: seagull control</h3>
<p>The principal legislation dealing with the control of birds is the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Generally, it is illegal to capture, injure or destroy any wild bird or interfere with its nest or eggs. The penalties for disregarding the law can be severe.Â </p>
<p>The law does recognise that particular species of common bird, such as herring and lesser black backed gulls, can cause nuisance. The law allows measures to be taken against such birds in limited circumstances.Â </p>
<p>Action can only be taken under general licences made under the 1981 Act for the purpose of preserving public health or public/air safety, preventing the spread of disease or for preventing serious damage to livestock, foodstuffs for livestock, crops.Â </p>
<p>An offence would be committed if action could not be justified or defended for any of these purposes.Â </p>
<p>Only the owner or occupier can take action against gulls nesting on their buildings. Alternatively they can give someone else permission to act on their behalf.â€¨Any action taken must be justified in terms of the law and can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The killing or taking of gulls</li>
<li>The damaging or destruction of their nests</li>
<li>The taking or destruction of their eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Action taken must be humane. Any inhumane method which could cause suffering would be illegal. The use of poisons or drugs to take or kill any bird is specifically prohibited except under very special circumstances and with a government licence.</p>
<p>In practice, there are very few humane methods to kill birds which are likely only to affect that particular species and skill and experience is needed to deploy them. The council is particularly keen to discourage shooting of gulls.</p>
<p>If you want to feed birds without encouraging seagulls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only put out bird food from November to May, as there is nearly always enough natural food available the rest of the year</li>
<li>Put food in wire baskets or under a roofed bird table so that only small birds can get it</li>
<li>Put out small amounts of food frequently rather than large amounts at a time</li>
</ul>
<p>Specialist companies can protect your building from gulls by installing wires or spikes on chimney pots and other rooftop features.</p>
<h3>Current Council Policy on Seagulls</h3>
<p>Although we have no statutory duty to take action against seagulls, since 2007, the council put in place a stakeholder forum to annually review the situation with nesting gulls in Hereford and agree a way forward on their control. This forum includes the public, Herefordshire Council members, Hereford City members, as well as businesses and experts in the control of birds. This forum annually reviews the effectiveness of control measures deployed and considers the various measures for controlling gulls available within the constraints of a government licence, the main ones being egg removal, nest removal, proofing and education.</p>
<p>In 2008, we first entered into a one year contract with Falconry Pest Control Services, who were commissioned to remove gull nests and eggs from April to August in Hereford city only. At this time it was estimated, via an independent survey, that there were between 400 to 500 breeding pairs on Hereford's rooftops.</p>
<p>Since 2009 we have renewed this contract every three years and since 2012 Hereford City Council had agreed to co-fund this work.</p>
<p>Currently, the egg and nest removal service will operate from 2015 until 2018, running from April to August every year, at two-weekly intervals by two contractors working in a van with a lifting platform. At present, this service is free to all, provided that the roof is accessible, roof permission is granted in writing, and the work can be done in under one hour.</p>
<p>The current thinking is that the breeding pairs in Hereford have dropped considerably from 500 in 2008 to approximately 200 in 2015. Taking into consideration an estimated population growth rate of 5% to 20% a year, this has reinforced our belief that the programme is working.</p>
<p>Please note we cannot touch live birds.</p>
<h3>Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>You can help prevent pest activity on your property by:Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Removing any possible food sources including fallen fruit, animal feed and accessible household waste</li>
<li>Keeping your rubbish in bins until the day of collection wherever practical</li>
<li>Making sure your bins have secured lids</li>
<li>Using special bird feeders rather than putting food on the floor</li>
<li>Not feeding your dogs and cats outdoors</li>
<li>Picking up and disposing of any litter outside your property</li>
<li>Clearing any undergrowth from your garden to remove possible nesting places.</li>
<li>Not putting any meats, bread or cooked food on a compost heap as this will attract vermin into your garden. Where possible secure fine grade wire meshing around and underneath your compost heap.</li>
<li>Commercial properties should keep the streets at the front and back of the premise free of litter and black rubbish bags</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breeding Birds</h3>
<p>The usual life cycle of a seagull is 15 to 20 years and they can start breeding after reaching maturity at the age of 4. Breeding birds mate for life and females only have a certain number of eggs they can lay in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Most gulls breed once a year and have predictable breeding seasons lasting for three to six months. The birds lay 2 to 3 speckled eggs in nests composed of vegetation. The incubation period lasts between 22 and 26 days, and begins after laying the first egg. Seagulls are attentive, caring parents and take turns incubating the eggs, and feeding and protecting the chicks.</p>
<h3>Controlling Seagull Methods</h3>
<p>There have been a few methods to try and cull seagull populations throughout the UK.</p>
<p>One method tested is when the eggs are pricked. This allows air into the protective sack that contains the embryo and stops it from growing further. Eventually, the parents realise the egg is dead and discard it, leaving space for a new egg to be laid.</p>
<p>However, leaving the eggs in the nest in this manner encourages aggressive behaviour from the parents as they remain protective until they discard them.</p>
<p>Another method tested is when the eggs are replaced with fake rubber eggs. However, the same problem occurs as the parents quickly discover the eggs are no longer alive and discard them.</p>
<p>Again, leaving the eggs in the nest in this manner encourages aggressive behaviour from the parents as they remain protective until they discard them.</p>
<p>Another method is when the eggs are oiled. The oil seals the egg so no oxygen can reach the embryo inside. However, as the parents lay on the eggs to incubate them, the oil tends to rub off onto the parentâ€™s feathers and is then cleaned off when the birds preen.</p>
<p>A further method is proofing buildings with nets and / or spikes. However, this is an extremely expensive method and due to the scale of buildings and properties in affected areas, the price in many cases is deemed to not be cost-effective.</p>
<p>The last method tested is when the eggs and nests are removed from a site and this is the method Herefordshire Council have opted to use.</p>
<p>When the eggs have been removed from the nest, seagulls can quickly relay more to replace the ones they have lost. The incubation period lasts between 22 and 26 days, so the eggs are removed every 14 days, long before the chick can hatch. As there are no eggs left in the nest after each visit, the parents lose their aggressive behaviour as there is nothing for them to be protective over.</p>
<p>This is a time consuming method, however, the more eggs removed from the nests, the more eggs a female will lay during a breeding season and will eventually become infertile.Â </p>
