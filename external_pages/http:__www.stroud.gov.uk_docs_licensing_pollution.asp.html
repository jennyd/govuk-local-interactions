<h2>Air Quality</h2>
<h3 class="closed" id="poorair">Poor Air Quality - Why Should We Care?</h3>
						<div class="reveal-text-box">

<p>The health impacts of poor air quality have long been established, especially with regard to respiratory conditions such as asthma and emphysema, which can be exacerbated by air pollution. Recent research has estimated that air pollution reduces the life expectancy of every person in the UK by 7-8 months. The air in the UK is at its cleanest since the 1950s, when legislation was first introduced to address the problems; however, the UK is projected to miss objectives for particulates, ozone and nitrogen dioxide and poor air quality still has a negative impact on peoples' health. </p>
							<p>The air quality objectives and policy options for improving air quality are set out in the UK Air Quality Strategy . The first strategy was adopted in 1997, with the most recent version published in 2007. The strategy highlights the integral role played by councils in managing air quality and achieving the Government's objectives through both Pollution Prevention and Control and Local Air Quality Management. It also set out a timetable for local authorities to review and assess air quality in their area against prescribed levels. </p>
							<p>The continued importance of councils' work in tackling air pollution was recently recognised by the Rogers Review . </p>

  <h4>The Rogers Review </h4>
<p>The Rogers Review, published in March 2007, recommended six national enforcement priorities for local authority regulatory services, one of which is air quality. The reasoning for the recommendation of air quality to be included as a priority was given as follows: </p>
                              <p>"Air quality is a high national political priority and actions taken to improve it will also contribute to tackling climate change. Local authorities have a vital role to play in delivering better outcomes. Air quality is a national enforcement priority because it impacts on whole populations, particularly the elderly and those more susceptible to air pollution. It is politically important to emphasize the role that local authorities can play in reducing its impacts, and its trans-boundary nature means that local action contributes to national outcomes." </p>
                              <h4>Air Quality Notes </h4>
                              <p>In both developed and rapidly industrializing countries, the major historic air pollution problem has typically been high levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide, arising from the combustion of sulphur-containing fossil fuels, such as coal. </p>
                              <p>The major threat to clean air is now posed by traffic emissions. Petrol and diesel engined motor vehicles emit a wide variety of pollutants, principally carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulates (PM10), which have an increasing impact on air quality. </p>
                              <p>In addition photochemical reactions resulting from the action of sunlight on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and VOCs from vehicles leads to the formation of ozone. This is a secondary long-range pollutant, which impacts in rural areas often far from the original emission site. Acid rain is another long-range pollutant influenced by vehicle NOx emissions. </p>
                              <p>Generally industrial and domestic pollutant sources, together with their impact on air quality, tend to be steady state or improving with time. However, traffic pollution problems are worsening world-wide. </p>
                              <p>Below is an introduction to the principal pollutants produced by industrial, domestic and traffic sources. </p>
                              <h4>Nitrogen Oxides </h4>
                              <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is mainly derived from road transport emissions and other combustion processes, is not considered to be harmful to health. However, once released to the atmosphere, NO is usually very rapidly oxidised to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is harmful to health. NO2 and NO are both oxides of nitrogen and together are referred to as nitrogen oxides (NOx). </p>
                              <p>Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. Continued or frequent exposure to concentrations that are typically much higher than those normally found in the ambient air may cause increased incidence of acute respiratory illness in children. </p>
                              <h4>Particles </h4>
                              <p>Fine particles are composed of a wide range of materials arising from a variety of sources including: </p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Combustion sources (mainly road traffic) </li>
                                <li>Secondary particles, mainly sulphates and nitrates formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and often transported from far across Europe </li>
                                <li>Coarse particles, suspended soils and dusts (e.g. from the Sahara), seasalt, biological particles and particles from construction work </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Particles are measured in a number of different size fractions according to their mean aerodynamic diameter. Most monitoring is currently focussed on PM10 but finer fractions such as PM2.5 and PM1 are becoming of increasing interest in terms of health effects. Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause inflammation and a worsening of the condition of people with heart and lung diseases. In addition, they may carry surface-absorbed carcinogenic compounds into the lungs. </p>
                              <h4>Ozone </h4>
                              <p>Ozone (O3) is not emitted directly from any man made source in any significant quantities. In the lower atmosphere, O3 is primarily formed by a complicated series of chemical reactions initiated by sunlight. </p>
                              <p>These reactions can be summarised as the sunlight-initiated oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The sources of VOCs are similar to those described for NOx above, but also include other activities such as solvent use and petrol distribution and handling. </p>
                              <p>The reactions can take hours or days. Therefore ozone measured at a particular location may have arisen from VOC and NOx emissions many miles away. Maximum concentrations generally occur downwind of the source of the precursor pollutant emissions. Ozone irritates the airways of the lungs, increasing the symptoms of those suffering from asthma and lung diseases. </p>
                              <h4>1,3-Butadiene </h4>
                              <p>1,3-butadiene, like benzene, is a VOC emitted into the atmosphere principally from fuel combustion of petrol and diesel vehicles. It is also an important chemical in certain industrial processes, particularly the manufacture of synthetic rubber. </p>
                              <p>Possible chronic health effects include cancer, central nervous system disorders, liver and kidney damage, reproductive disorders and birth defects. </p>
                              <h4>Benzene </h4>
                              <p>Benzene is what is known as a VOC. It is a minor constituent of petrol, is used as a fluid for cleaning, in the extraction of oils from seeds and nuts, in the printing process and cigarette smoke. It is also used in the manufacture of chemicals, such as plastics, resins, nylon and synthetic fibres, detergents, explosives, drugs and dyes. </p>
                              <p>The main source in the atmosphere in Europe is the distribution and combustion of petrol. Of these, combustion by petrol vehicles is the biggest source (over 70% of total emissions). <br />
  Possible chronic health effects include cancer, central nervous system disorders, liver and kidney damage, reproductive disorders and birth defects. </p>
                              <h4>Sulphur dioxide </h4>
                              <p>Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is produced when a material, or fuel, containing sulphur is burned. Globally, much of the SO2 in the atmosphere comes from natural sources, but in the UK the predominant source is power stations burning fossil fuels. Widespread domestic use of coal can result in high local concentrations. </p>
                              <p>Even moderate concentrations may result in a fall in lung function in asthmatics. Tightness in the chest and coughing occur at high levels and asthmatics may require medical help. SO2 pollution is considered more harmful when particulate and other pollutant concentrations are high. </p>
                              <h4>Carbon monoxide </h4>
                              <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, poisonous gas produced by incomplete, or inefficient combustion of fuel. It is predominantly produced by road transport, in particular, petrol-engine vehicles. </p>
                              <p>This gas prevents the normal transport of oxygen by the blood. This can lead to a significant reduction in the supply of oxygen to the heart, particularly in people suffering from heart disease. </p>
                              <h4>Lead </h4>
                              <p>Since the introduction of unleaded petrol in the UK, there has been a significant reduction in urban lead levels. In recent years industry, in particular secondary non-ferrous metal smelters, have become the most significant contributors to emissions of lead. The highest concentrations of lead and heavy metals are now therefore found around these installations in industrial areas. </p>
                              <p>Even small amounts of lead can be harmful, especially to infants and young children. In addition, lead taken in by the mother can interfere with the health of the unborn child. Exposure has also been linked to impaired mental function, visual-motor performance and neurological damage in children and memory and attention span. </p>
                              <h4>Toxic organic micropollutants TOMPS </h4>
                              <p>TOMPS are produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels. They comprise a complex range of chemicals some of which, although they are emitted in very small quantities, are highly toxic or carcinogenic. Compounds in this category include: </p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) </li>
                                <li>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) </li>
                                <li>Dioxins </li>
                                <li>Furans </li>
                                <li>TOMPS can cause a wide range of effects, from cancer, to reduced immunity, to nervous system disorders and interfering with child development. There is no threshold dose - the tiniest amount can cause damage. </li>
                              </ul>

<h2>Bonfires and Fireworks</h2>
<h3 class="closed" id="bonfires">Garden Bonfires</h3>
						<div class="reveal-text-box">
<p>Garden bonfires have been a traditional way of disposing of garden rubbish but they often cause a nuisance to neighbours from smoke, smell or dirt. They also contribute to air pollution. As a means of disposal, bonfires are becoming less and less acceptable. This section aims to encourage householders to give up bonfires and to suggest some alternatives. </p>
						<h4>The Problems<br />
						</h4>
						<ul>
                          <li>Bonfires can be very annoying to neighbours - usually from smoke or smell. This can stop them from enjoying their garden, prevent them from opening their windows, or hanging out washing. This is especially a problem if your neighbour or their children are asthmatic or have a chest condition. </li>
                          <li>Bonfires cause air pollution. They can produce irritating and even poisonous compounds that contribute to poor air quality, which everyone nearby then has to breathe in. </li>
                          <li>Bonfire smoke can also cause a hazard to road users by reducing visibility. </li>
                          <li>Bonfires can cause a fire hazard if they are close to trees or fences and especially if left unattended. </li>
						  </ul>
						<h4>What's the Legal Position? </h4>
						<p>There are no specific laws that prohibit garden bonfires, nor any which restricts them to certain hours of the day, days of the week or number per year. </p>
						<p>If, however, a garden bonfire causes what is called a "statutory nuisance", the Council can serve a legal notice on the person responsible requiring them to stop causing the nuisance. Failure to do so is then an offence for which they can be prosecuted. Under the same legislation any person affected by a bonfire can also lodge a complaint at the Magistrates Court alleging nuisance, which will then be dealt with by the court. If it is found that a nuisance did exist the person responsible can be fined by the court. </p>
						<h4>Bonfire Guidelines
						</h4>
						<p>If after having carefully considered the alternatives you still decide to have a bonfire, there are some guidelines that will help to ensure that you don't cause a nuisance: </p>
						<ul>
                          <li>Only burn dry material. </li>
                          <li>Never burn household rubbish or anything with plastic, foam, paint, or rubber in it. </li>
                          <li>Never use old engine oil, methylated spirits, or petrol to light or encourage a fire. Not only does this make smoke, it is also very dangerous. </li>
                          <li>Avoid lighting fires in unsuitable weather conditions such as damp, still days. </li>
                          <li>Avoid times when the wind will blow smoke over roads or into neighbours gardens. </li>
                          <li>Avoid burning when people want to enjoy their gardens such as weekends or Bank Holidays. </li>
                          <li>Air Quality is described using four bands - LOW, MODERATE, HIGH and VERY HIGHT. Avoid burning when air quality in the area is anything other than Low. You can check this by telephoning the Air Pollution Bulletin Service on Freephone 0800-556677 which gives daily levels of air pollution. </li>
                          <li>Never leave a fire unattended or leave it to smoulder. </li>
                          <li>Bear in mind the law of statutory nuisance mentioned above; regular smoky bonfires - or even a single one which is very polluting - could be regarded as a statutory nuisance and result in a legal notice being served on you by the Council. </li>
						  </ul>
						<h4>What are the alternatives?</h4>
						<p><strong>1. Take it to the tip </strong></p>
						<p>You can take your garden rubbish to one of the Stroud District Council refuse disposal points. <br />
    These are located at: </p>
						<p><em><strong>Pyke Quarry (Horsley) </strong></em><br />
  This is two miles west of HORSLEY on the B4058, Wotton under Edge road. </p>
						<p><em><strong>Hempsted, (Gloucester) </strong></em><br />
  This is one mile from Gloucester Docks along Llanthony Road then Hempsted Lane. Turn right just before the roundabout (signposted) when travelling towards Hempsted </p>
						<p>These are managed by Gloucestershire County Council. See <a href="http://www.recycleforgloucestershire.com/">www.recyleforgloucestershire.com</a> for details and opening times.</p>
						<p><strong>2. Hold or attend a garden shredding event</strong></p>
						<p>Do you and your neighbours have garden waste that could be shredded and turned into material suitable for mulching beds or borders? </p>
						<p>You can arrange with our grounds maintenance contractor, Wyevale to have a chipping machine brought to your property for a community composting event. These events are advertised to local residents and are open for anybody in the neighbourhood to bring their green waste to the designated site for mulching. </p>
						<p>Wyevale on 07833 091294 (daytime) or 01453 758293 . </p>
						<p><strong>3. Compost your garden and household waste</strong></p>
						<p>Some garden waste and household waste is suitable for composting. See <a href="../community/composting.asp">our composting page</a> for information about how to go about it. </p>

															  <h4> What can the Council do about firework noise? </h4>
					  <p> There is no specific law to deal with noise nuisances caused by fireworks and the ordinary noise nuisance laws may not be applicable to firework noise for the following reasons</p>

<p>A 'nuisance in law' must be a continuous state of affairs. A firework event, held maybe once a year for an hour or so, is not ongoing.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that any one event or person is solely causing the noise problem when there may be scores of similar events in the locality. </p>

<p>It can be extremely difficult to pinpoint which premises is hosting the event and identify the person responsible which may be different from the owner. </p>
					                         <h4>Can the Police do anything about fireworks?</h4>
					  <p>The Police can deal with fireworks being let off in the street, being put through letter boxes and those set-off within 25 metres of a main road. </p>

<h3 class="closed" id="aboutcont">About Contaminated Land</h3>
						<div class="reveal-text-box">

<p>In common with many other countries, the UK has a legacy of land contamination arising from industrial development and related operational practices. The Stroud District has a long history of industrial activity, the basis of which was the wool and textile industry, along with associated processes such as the manufacture of dyes. In addition the District was host to a wide variety of other industrial uses including brickworks, gasworks, lime burning, quarrying, wire manufacture, fellmongery and tanning, board manufacture, fireworks, artificial manure and land filling operations.</p>
<p>These industrial activities often resulted in contamination of the land, which, if not properly dealt with, can pose a risk to public health and the environment.</p>
<p>The type of contamination varies from site to site, and is not always visible. Not all contamination poses a problem; some may only be a concern when the land is used for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>The Council tackles contamination in a number of ways; through the planning process, through the Inspection Strategy and through prevention.</p>
<p>All planning applications are checked to see if they are situated on land known or suspected to have had a potentially contaminative former use. Where appropriate, conditions are applied requiring the developer to carry out an investigation of the site and where necessary to undertake remediation (clean-up) if contamination is found. Remediation must be to a standard that makes the land suitable for the proposed use.</p>
<p>It is a statutory duty under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to identify contaminated land and to ensure itâs clean up. The Council has produced <a href="/info/contaminated_strategy.pdf">A Strategy for the Identification of Contaminated Land</a> setting out how it intends to carry out its duties under this legislation.</p>
<p>The Council has a duty to regulate a number of industrial processes which could give rise to further land contamination. The Council works closely with various regulatory partners, including the Environment Agency, to prevent new contamination being caused, or to require clean-up by the responsible polluter.</p>

<h3 class="closed" id="landreg">Contaminated Land Public Register</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">

<p>The Environmental Protection Act 1990 Part IIa requires Stroud District Council to maintain a public register. A register entry will be created when one of the following happens:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the land is designated a special site </li>
   <li>a remediation declaration is published </li>
   <li>a remediation statement is published, or </li>
   <li>a remediation notice is served. </li>
</ul>
 <p>This means the Council does not have to put the notification that the land is contaminated land on the register until one of these actions has been undertaken. At this point much of the information that was contained in the original notification will be included in the register entry.</p>

 <p>The regulations specify the information to be included in the register. Therefore the register will include:</p>


 <ul>
   <li>remediation notices </li>
   <li>site information and details of site reports obtained by the authority relating to remediation notices </li>
   <li>designation of sites as 'special sites' </li>
   <li>site specific guidance issued by the Environment Agency </li>

   <li>remediation declarations, remediation statements and notifications of claimed remediation </li>
   <li>any appeals lodged against remediation and charging notices </li>
   <li>convictions for non compliance with notices </li>
   <li>statement regarding the existence of confidential information </li>
 </ul>

 <p>The absence of an entry on the register does not guarantee that</p>
 <ul>
 <li>the land is free from contamination, as it may not have been fully assessed </li>
 <li>the contamination present does not pose significant risk</li>
 <li>contamination present is not polluting controlled waters</li>

 </ul>
 <p>If you require any further information, then please do not hesitate to contact our <strong>contaminated land officer</strong> on 01453 754469</p>

<h3 class="closed" id="faq">Contaminated Land - Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">

<p><b>Q) WHAT IS MEANT BY <i>"CONTAMINATED LANDâ?</i></b> </p>
<p><b>A)</b>  Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 introduced a legal definition of</p>
<p>Contaminated Land. The legislation states:  "Contaminated Land" is any land which appears to the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in such a condition, by reason of substances in, on or under the land, that: </p>
<ul>
<li>significant harm is being caused or there is a significant possibility of such harm being caused; or </li>
<li>pollution of controlled waters is being, or is likely to be, caused </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that land that does not fit the legal definition of Contaminated</p>
<p>Land may still be affected by contamination. </p>
<p><b>Q)</b> <b>WHAT CAUSES (OR CAUSED) CONTAMINATED LAND?</b></p>
<p><b>A)</b> Many industrial processes have the potential to cause, or have caused, contamination of the ground. Industries that have previously been present in</p>
<p>Stroud include wool and textile mills, dye works, gasworks sites, petroleum storage sites, engineering works, railway land, metals processing and timber yards.</p>
<p>Contamination can also arise as a result of landfilling, illegal dumping, accidental spillages of substances or leaks from underground tanks and pipes. </p>
<p><b>Q)</b> <b>IF A SITE IS AFFECTED BY CONTAMINATION WHAT CAN BE DONE?</b></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>) In many circumstances no action will ultimately be necessary, because the level of contamination present will not present a significant risk to health. Where levels of contamination are more severe, clean-up will be required, to ensure the site no longer presents an unacceptable risk to public health or the environment.</p>
<p>There are often many different ways a site may be remediated, depending on the type of contamination present and the specific nature of the site. Often contaminated soils are simply excavated and removed from site for disposal. Alternatively a layer of clean soil might be placed above the contaminated soils, to prevent contact or a range of other protective measures, such as ventilation systems, can be incorporated into buildings to prevent the build-up of harmful gases or vapours.</p>
<p>A number of new technologies also exist for treating contamination. Where these are appropriate the Council will view use of these technologies favourably as they avoid transport of contaminated soil to landfill and are therefore more sustainable.</p>
<p><b>Q) WHO PAYS FOR CONTAMINATED LAND TO BE CLEANED-UP?</b></p>
<p><b>A)</b> Where a contaminated site is being redeveloped it is the developer who is responsible for ensuring safe development and pays for any investigation and remediation required.</p>
<p>Should a site be legally determined to be "Contaminated Land" under the regulations, then it is usually the person or organisation that originally caused the contamination that is responsible for any clean-up required. In some circumstances, where the original polluter cannot be identified or no longer exists, then liability for remediation may fall on the current landowner. In certain circumstances the landowner may also be unable to pay for remediation, in which case final responsibility may fall to the District Council. </p>
<p><b>Q)</b><b>  HOW CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT A SPECIFIC PROPERTY IN </b><b>STROUD</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><b>A)</b> If you are buying a new home your solicitor will conduct a standard search of our  Register of Contaminated Land. In addition the Council maintains a database of sites that have had a former potentially contaminative use, and may also hold additional information regarding potential contamination, investigation or clean-up undertaken. An environmental search will often identify previous potentially contaminative land uses that may have been present in the vicinity of a property. </p>
<p>Anyone can request information from our records for a specific property in Stroud District. All such requests should be submitted by email (or in writing) to the Senior Contaminated Land Officer. Requests should include a location plan clearly showing the boundary of the site in question.</p>
<p>In response to such enquiries the Council will provide factual information only. A specialist environmental consultant should be engaged if interpretation of this information is required.</p>
<p><b>Please note we may not always have sufficient information to answer your enquiries fully.</b> </p>
<p>The Council publishes a guidance document for homeowners and prospective homebuyers affected by potential land contamination.  </p>
<p><b>Q) </b><b>I AM BUYING/SELLING A PROPERTY AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL SEARCH HAS RAISED CONCERNS. WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b></p>
<p><b>A)</b> Environmental searches may raise questions about potentially contaminative land use. The Council may hold more specific information about individual sites, and planning conditions imposed during development of former industrial land.  Ultimately it might be that a property is located in an area subject to a previous potentially contaminative use, no further information is available, and the site therefore is scheduled for further inspection as part of the Council's Inspection Strategy. In such circumstances the buyers/sellers involved will have to reach their own understanding of how they wish to interpret and react to the available information. In some circumstances individuals may wish to undertake their own ground investigations, or consider available insurance products. </p>
<p>The Contaminated Land Officer will be happy to respond to all enquiries and will offer advice and assistance on such matters, wherever possible. Note that a charge may be made for providing a written response to enquiries in some circumstances. The Council publishes a guidance document for homeowners and prospective homebuyers affected by potential land contamination.</p>
<p><b>Q)</b> <b>I AM DEVELOPING A SITE AND HAVE A CONTAMINATED LAND PLANNING CONDITION ON MY PLANNING APPROVAL. WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b></p>
<p><b>A) </b>If you have made a planning application relating to a site that is considered potentially contaminated, then you may have a specific condition attached to your Approval Notice. The presence of such a condition does not indicate that the site is contaminated, only that the Council feels further assessment or works are required to ensure that the development can be implemented with adequate regard for environmental and public safety. </p>
<p>The wording of planning conditions is designed to cover a broad range of issues on a variety of sites, in many cases the work required will be simpler than the condition</p>
<p>wording suggests. Please contact the Councilâs Contaminated Land Officer to discuss the specific details of your development.  The Council publishes a guidance document for developers of potentially contaminated land and their advisors. </p>
<p><b>Q)</b> <b>HOW CAN I GET FURTHER INFORMATION?</b></p>
<p><b>A)</b> If you would like to speak with a Council Officer regarding land contamination in</p>
<p>The Stroud District, or wish to enquire about a particular property please contact the Councilâs Senior Contaminated Land Officer on 01453 754469 or e-mail <a href="mailto:katie.larner@stroud.gov.uk">katie.larner@stroud.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 class="closed" id="highhedge">High Hedges</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">
<p>Part 8 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, gives local authorities powers to deal with complaints about high hedges, and this came into operation in England on 1 June 2005. From this date, provided they have tried and exhausted all other avenues for resolving their hedge dispute, people will be able to take their complaint about a neighbour's evergreen hedge to their local Council.
</p><p>The role of the District Council is not to mediate or negotiate between the complainant and the hedge owner but to adjudicate on whether - in the words of the Act - the hedge is adversely affecting the complainant's reasonable enjoyment of their property. In doing so, the Council must take account of all relevant factors and strike a balance between the competing interests of the complainant and hedge owner, as well as the interests of the wider community. </p>
<p>If the Council consider the circumstances justified, and all frivolous or vexatious complaints deterred, then a formal notice can be issued to the hedge owner which will set out what they must do to the hedge to remedy the problem, and when by. Failure to carry out the works required by the authority is an offence which, on prosecution, could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000. </p>
<p>At the District Council Cabinet meeting held at Ebley Mill, Stroud on the 2 July 2005, it was recommended to Council to approve the initial full complaints fee of Â£300 with effect from the 1 June 2005, but will be subject to review after a period of three months. In addition, it was also recommended that a reduced rate of Â£100 for applicants in receipt of state benefits also be approved and reviewed after six months. </p>
