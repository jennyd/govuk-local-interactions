			<p>If you are experiencing health problems and are struggling to get out to to the shops, or to prepare healthy meals for yourself at home, you may find that there are ways in which you can overcome these difficulties - check out our pages on <a title="regaining your independence" href="/info/200335/at_home/1076/staying_in_your_own_home/2">regaining your independence</a>, <a title="help with walking and mobility" href="/info/200335/at_home/1076/staying_in_your_own_home/3">help with walking and mobility</a>, and <a title="equipment to help at home" href="/info/200335/at_home/1076/staying_in_your_own_home/4">equipment to help at home</a>.<br /><br />On this page we have provided some suggestions on how you can continue to access a <a title="healthy eating" href="/info/200334/health_and_wellbeing/1041/taking_care_of_yourself/6">healthy, balanced diet</a>, and to enjoy your food, even if you are no longer able to prepare a meal for yourself.<br /><br /><strong>Equipment in your kitchen</strong><br />There are a whole range of gadgets and devices which have been specially designed to allow people with disabilities and health problems to be more independent in the kitchen. You may find that these can make all the difference in allowing you to prepare food for yourself rather than relying on others to do it for you. Go to our <a title="equipment to help at home" href="https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200335/at_home/1076/staying_in_your_own_home/4">equipment to help at home</a> page to see what might be available.<br /><br /><strong>Ready meals</strong><br />If you are finding it difficult to prepare a hot main meal for yourself, and you are able to use an oven or microwave, you could consider buying ready meals.<br /><br />These meals come already made up and simply need cooking or heating up in the cooker or microwave. They come chilled or frozen and you can buy them from any supermarket, online or even over the phone (see below).<br /><br />Ready meals cater for people with all dietary needs. These can include diabetic, low fat, low salt, low sugar, gluten free, vegetarian, and egg free meals.<br /><br />Although ready meals can be very handy, you should always read the label to make sure you're maintaining a <a title="healthy eating" href="https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200334/health_and_wellbeing/1041/taking_care_of_yourself/6">healthy, balanced diet</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Problems getting to the shops?</strong><br />If you are having trouble getting out and about there are ways to ensure that you get the food and other shopping which you need.<br /><br />Alternatively most of the big supermarkets have a home shopping delivery service which you can access on-line:<br /></p>

This will bring a pre-prepared hot meal to your home at lunchtime each day.

lot of people across the UK at the moment. Some people end up being 
unable to afford to buy food for themselves and their loved ones. There 
are some organisations out there who can help if you find yourself in 
this situation.<br /><br />The NHS has produced advice on <a href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/pdf/eating%20on%20a%20budget.pdf" title="Eating on a budget">eating on a budget</a>.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.trusselltrust.org/map" title="Trussell Trust">The Trussell Trust</a>
