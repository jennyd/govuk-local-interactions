<div class="clearfix span-36">
	<div class="site_resource clearfix">
			<p>This page gives information about transport for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, to and from schools, sixth form centres and further education colleges. General information on home to education transport can be found on the <a href="http://www.durham.gov.uk/schooltransport" target="_blank" title="School transport">school transport</a> page of Durham County Council's website.</p>
<h2><b>Primary and secondary schools</b></h2>
<p>Free travel is generally made available to allow children to attend the nearest suitable primary, secondary or special school, where the distance between home and school is:</p>
<ul>
<li>over two miles for pupils aged under 8 years (but Durham County Council will provide this up until the start of the academic year after their eighth birthday), or</li>
<li>more than three miles for pupils aged 8 to 16 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children may be provided with transport to a qualifying school which is within the statutory walking distance.  All relevant circumstances in relation to the child and family will be taken into consideration as to whether the applicant child is an ‘eligible child’ under the relevant legislation. </p>
<p>In addition for those children with a Statement of Special Educational Needs or an EHC Plan, free transport may also be made available in individual circumstances, in line with the duty upon the council to provide such transport, to other than the nearest suitable school as long as this is not incompatible with the efficient use of the resources of the County Council.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;"><a href="http://www.durham.gov.uk/article/2918/Apply-for-free-school-travel" title="Apply here for free school travel"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;">Apply here for free school travel</span></a></span></p>
<h2>Primary or secondary school with enhanced mainstream provision</h2>
<p> We have some mainstream schools with enhanced provision for children and young people with particular types of special educational needs.  Details of those schools can be found on the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;"><a href="http://www.countydurhamfamilies.info/kb5/durham/fsd/site.page?id=9a9_a6ZMyzk" target="_blank" title="provision for children with SEND"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;">provision for children with special education needs and disabilities page</span></a></span>.</p>
<p>Children and young people no longer require a Statement of SEN or an EHC Plan to be considered for a place in one of those schools.</p>
<p>If a child or young person is offered a place by Durham County Council in one of the enhanced mainstream provisions, free travel is generally available to the nearest suitable primary or secondary school with that type of provision and where the distance between home and school is:</p>
<ul>
<li>over two miles for pupils aged under 8 years (but Durham County Council will provide this up until the start of the academic year after their eighth birthday), or</li>
<li>more than three miles for pupils aged 8 to 16 years. </li>
</ul>
<p>Children may be provided with transport to a qualifying school which is within the statutory walking distance.  All relevant circumstances in relation to the child and family will be taken into consideration as to whether the applicant child is an ‘eligible child’ under the relevant legislation. </p>
<p>In addition for those children with a Statement of Special Educational Needs or an EHC Plan, free transport may also be made available in individual circumstances, in line with the duty upon the Local Authority to provide such transport, to other than the nearest suitable school with that type of provision as long as this is not incompatible with the efficient use of the resources of the County Council.</p>
<h2><b>National extended transport rights   </b></h2>
<p>For children eligible for free school meals or whose parents receive their maximum level of Working Tax Credit, national "extended" transport rights apply, please contact the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;"><a href="http://www.durham.gov.uk/schooltransport" target="_blank" title="School Admissions and Transport Team"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;">School Admissions and Transport Team</span></a></span> for further information.</p>
<h2><b>Post 16 provision</b></h2>
<p>Post 16 students who, in the view of the local authority, are unable to travel independently, for example are unable to access a viable public transport system or by reason of a medical condition or a special educational need and/or disability (SEND), may receive assistance with transport.</p>
<p>Travel assistance is not made available for part-time students (ie those studying less than 15 guided learning hours per week over a 30 week period) and students who commence a programme of learning after their nineteenth birthday. Students in receipt of an allowance for attending college (for example an employed apprenticeship), attending a higher education course or attending independent fee-paying establishments are not entitled to travel assistance.</p>

<h2><b>Personal budgets</b></h2>
<p>From September 2014, parents/carers of a child with an EHC Plan, or the young person if he or she is between the ages of 16 and 25, has a right to request a personal budget for some or all of the provision.  Transport would only be recorded in a Statement of SEN or an EHC Plan in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p> Find out more about <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;"><a href="http://www.countydurhamfamilies.info/kb5/durham/fsd/site.page?id=ahVrrV48U18" target="_self" title="Personal budgets"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;">personal budgets</span></a></span>.</p>
<p>The transport costs could be considered as part of a personal budget if a child or young person was entitled to free home to school or home to college transport.  In making a decision, the authority would have to be satisfied that:</p>
<ul>
<li>any different arrangements would meet the needs of the child or young person, and</li>
<li>no additional costs would be incurred by the authority</li>
</ul>
<p> If you are interested in making alternative arrangements, you will need to contact the Sustainable Transport Team on 03000 264 444 or email <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;"><a href="mailto:schooltransportteam@durham.gov.uk" title="email school transport "><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;">stgmonitoring@durham.gov.uk</span></a></span></p>
<h2><b>Getting around</b></h2>
<p>Most of us make a number of different types of journeys every day. These might include travelling to education, training, work, medical appointments or purely for fun. Our <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;"><a href="http://www.countydurhamfamilies.info/kb5/durham/fsd/site.page?id=LpSl7X4eTMA" target="_self" title="Getting Around"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #21759b;">getting around</span></a></span> page will give you useful information about travel options.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, a young person with learning difficulties and/or disabilities will be encouraged to travel on public transport, especially when this is considered to be a factor in developing their independent, life and social skills.</p>
<p>County Durham Transport Partnership has supported the development of independent travel activity for all students aged 16-19 in full-time education.</p>
<p>The purpose is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote independent travel for young people who are currently being provided with transport funded by public bodies</li>
<li>introduce independent travel programmes into school and college settings</li>
<li>develop materials for independent travel training</li>
</ul>
<p>Students wishing to access the scheme should contact their school or college.</p></div>
