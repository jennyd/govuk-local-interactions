                  <h3 class="closed" id="reg">Listed Buildings</h3>
                  <div class="reveal-text-box">
                    <p>Listed buildings can be all sorts of structures including telephone boxes, letter boxes, walls and gates as well as what we all recognise as buildings. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">National Planning Policy Framework</a> and its associated document <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing/planning-permission">Historic Environment Planning Practice Guide</a> states that a listed building is one "of special architectural or historic interest". The primary legislation controlling listed buildings is the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/pdfs/ukpga_19900009_en.pdf">Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990</a>. </p>
                    <p>Buildings are listed/de-listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport advised by English Heritage. The listing is periodically reviewed by Historic England. Anyone can ask for a building to be listed or de-listed. They should support their request to the department with a clear map identifying the location of the property, plans, photographs and a clear explanation of why they are seeking inclusion or deletion from the list. An application form can be found at <a href="http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/">Historic England</a>.</p>
                    <p>There are three grades of listed building:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Exceptional interest - Grade I </li>
                      <li>Particular importance - Grade II* </li>
                      <li>Special interest - Grade II </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What is listed? </h4>
                    <p>When a building is listed the whole of the structure is listed: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>internally and externally </li>
                      <li>interior fixtures and fittings </li>
                      <li>garden structures and ornaments if they were part of the original scheme </li>
                      <li>structures attached to the listed building, and</li>
                        <li>Separate buildings/structures within its boundaries, which were there before 1 July 1948 </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why are buildings listed? </h4>
                    <p>The following are the main criteria applied when deciding which buildings to include in the statutory lists: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Architectural interest: all buildings which are of importance to the nation for the interest of their architectural design, decoration and craftsmanship. Also includes important examples of particular building types and techniques and significant plan forms </li>
                      <li>Historic interest: buildings which illustrate important aspects of the nation's social, economic, cultural or military history </li>
                      <li>Close historical association: with nationally important people or events <br />
                      </li>
                      <li>Group Value: where buildings form an important architectural or historic unity or a fine example of planning (such as squares, terraces or model villages) </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Not all these criteria will be relevant to every case, but a particular building may qualify for listing under more than one of them</p>
                    <h4>Listed Buildings in the Stroud District </h4>
                    <p>You can now view Listed Buildings in the Stroud District using English Heritage national heritage list.</p>

                      <h2>Listed Building Consent Application Forms</h2>
                      <p>Listed Building Consent is required for the demolition of any Listed Building, or for any alterations or extensions to a Listed Building that affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest. </p>
                      <p> It may also be required for repairs to listed buildings and any works to curtilage listed buildings, as these are afforded the same protection as listed buildings. Consent may need to be obtained even if planning permission is not required for the work. </p>
                      <p>It is a criminal offence to carry out works to a listed building without consent. </p>

                      <p>Applications for Listed Building Consent must be made to us. There is no fee for such applications, and full guidance notes for applicants are available along with application forms on request or available to download below.  However, please note that: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                         Detailed existing and proposed scale drawings and floor plans will be required. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                         In most cases plans, elevations and sections at a scale of 1:50 will suffice, clearly annotated to show the extent of retention and/or removal of the existing features and fabric of the building. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                         Alterations to features such as windows will require drawings at a larger scale such as 1:10 or 1:5 for clarification. 
                        </li>
                       
                        <li>
                          Details of the new materials to be used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Photographs of the elements to be altered, extensively repaired or removed may be useful. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          If consent is granted we may attach conditions which will require you to submit further information before work commences. All conditions should be read carefully and must be complied with. It is a criminal offence if the works begin without formal approval of the conditional detail. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        If consent is refused you have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State. </li>

<p>The council monitors the state of the most vulnerable of its listed buildings. In recent years, the Council has been successful with having three of its most vulnerable and un-occupied buildings repaired (by new owners). The current list of buildings on at category 1 or 2 (Greatest Risk and At Risk) can be viewed below: </p>

                  <div class="reveal-text-box">
                    <p>Conservation areas are designated by the district council when an area is recognised to have a special character or appearance worthy of protection. Within conservation areas there are greater restrictions over works which require planning permission. Applications for planning permission for new development in conservation areas are more rigorously assessed to consider whether proposals preserve or enhance the special character or appearance of the conservation area. </p>
                    <p>A number of special controls and requirements apply in conservation areas to protect their character: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>consent is needed to demolish buildings and other structures </li>
                      <li>new development must be well designed and the use of in-keeping traditional natural materials will normally be required </li>
                      <li>new buildings, extensions and alterations must preserve or enhance the appearance of the conservation area. Most minor household alterations affecting external appearance (windows, roofing, installation of satellite dish, fencing and so on) are likely to require planning permission </li>
                      <li>trees in conservation areas are protected. For trees not already protected by tree preservation orders (where this applies), a notification must be submitted to the council's trees officer six weeks before any works to a tree are due to start </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you live in a conservation area and are thinking about carrying out alterations to your property, demolishing a building or carrying out work to trees, it is recommended that you first seek advice from the council as planning permission or conservation area consent may be required. </p>
                   <!-- <div class="highlight-box">
                      <h2>Conservation Area Consent Application Forms</h2>
                      <p>Conservation area consent is needed before you may demolish most types of building or structure in a conservation area. There are various exceptions to this requirement, such as small buildings with a total volume of less than 115 cubic metres (about 20 foot square by 10 foot high), walls next to the highway under one metre high, and listed buildings (which, instead require listed building consent). </p>
                      <p>Conservation area consent is only required for: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Total demolition of a building; </li>
                        <li>Very substantial destruction of a building (perhaps leaving just one wall of the building); or, </li>
                        <li>Demolition of a distinct part of a building, such as the removal of a clearly defined wing. </li>

                    <p>Below shows all the current Conservation Areas in Stroud District. A process of assessment and review is underway and Conservation Area Statements (CAS) are being produced for each one. Given the number of conservation areas in Stroud District, this is a lengthy process and we are only able to produce a small number per year. </p>
                    <h4>A Conservation Area Statement consists of two parts: </h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A character appraisal. This identifies what it is that makes each conservation area distinctive and highlights the features of special architectural or historic interest that contribute to its character and appearance. </li>
                      <li>A set of management proposals, designed to ensure the preservation or enhancement of the conservation area's character or appearance. This usually includes policies, enhancement proposals, boundary amendments, design guidance and the identification of any buildings at risk. Management proposals for conservation areas must be adopted as Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD), forming part of the Stroud District Local Development Framework. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>View the links below to find out where the review and appraisal process has got to for each of the District's conservation areas. You can view adopted and draft CAS documents. During periods of public consultation for each review, you can use these pages to make comments and get involved. </p>

                      <p>Wotton Under Edge was first designated as a conservation area in August 1972. It was extended in 1988 and some minor boundary changes were made in 1999 during its first review and appraisal. </p>
                      <p>A Conservation Area Statement was adopted for Wotton Under Edge in November 1999. The Conservation Area Statement contains policies and proposals for the preservation and enhancement of the conservation area, which are used to guide the interpretation and application of Development Plan policies, but this document does not have Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) status. </p>

                      <p>On 2nd April 1993, the Secretary of State issued a Direction, which enables the Local Planning Authority to apply controls to certain works of alteration to specific buildings in the conservation area. These works would normally be âpermitted development', but in a conservation area an Article 4 direction may be applied, requiring planning permission to be sought for the sorts of works that are deemed to be likely to have a harmful effect on the character or appearance of the conservation area. </p>

                      <h4>Article 4 Direction </h4>
                      <p>Although the Permitted Development Rights of houses (and buildings other than shops and flats) are restricted within a Conservation Area, the additional controls brought about by designation of the Conservation Area cannot sufficiently prevent many changes to these buildings. If unchecked, a successive number of such changes could damage the character of the Conservation Area. </p>
                      <p>For this reason, the Local Authority made an Article 4 (2) Direction on 11th February 1998. Article 4 Directions allow the Local Planning Authority to apply controls to works of alteration to dwellinghouses, which were previously allowed through Permitted Development Rights. As a consequence of an Article 4 Direction, certain works to specified properties require an application for Planning Permission. For such applications there will be no planning fee payable. </p>
                      <p>In the case of an Article 4 (2) direction, the controls only apply in circumstances where the proposed works are on elevations which front a highway or public open space. </p>
                      <p>The following buildings are covered by the Direction. These are unlisted buildings, in use as dwellinghouses, and as such they would normally have greater permitted development rights than other buildings in the Conservation Area. </p>

                    <p>Trees that are considered to be of amenity value can be subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO). Once an Order has been served it is an offence to then fell or prune protected trees without prior consent. </p>

                    <p>Formal permission is not required to fell protected trees that are dead, dying or dangerous. However, unless the situation demands emergency action, it is necessary to contact the Councils Arboricultralist who will be able to advise whether or not the tree is within this category. The Council may agree to the removal of a protected tree, but the owner will normally be required to replace the tree with one of a suitable species and size. </p>
                    <p>Trees that are within a Conservation Area are protected in much the same way as those with a Preservation Order on them. If you intend to carry out work to trees within a conservation area you need to complete and return the application form. You must give at least six weeks notice in writing to the Council if you intend to carry out work to trees in a Conservation Area. </p>

                    <p>Customers of the planning service fall under many categories. These can include: those applying for planning permission, those making representations on applications, Town and Parish Councils, the business community, Councillors, other parts of the Council, Statutory Bodies, interest groups, and other organisations interested in planning applications and the local planning process. </p>
                    <h4>Our commitment to you:</h4>
                    <p>We aim to provide a friendly, courteous and prompt service and strive to maintain high professional standards. This allows us to make the best possible decisions for local communities. </p>
                    <p>In particular, we aim to achieve the following general service standards: </p>
                    <ul>

                  <h4>Referring applications to Development Control Committee:</h4>
                  <p>The Councilâs constitution contains the rules on what applications are dealt with by officers, and which ones can, on request, be referred to the Development Control Committee.</p>
                  <p>
                      In short, all applications are determined by officers unless the Chair of the Committee or the Head of Planning feels that it should be referred. The accepted criteria is that the application raises issues that will have an effect beyond the local area. 
                    </p>
                  <p>The Chair of the Committee will accept requests from town and parish councils or the district councillor for that ward.
                    </p>
                  <p>It should be noted that the Case Officer handling the file merely makes a recommendation to either the Committee or to a panel for peer review. The peer review for most applications will involve at least two principal planners or managers, none of whom have been actively involved in the project.

They provide a means to ensure that a proposed development contributes to the provision of necessary infrastructure and facilities required by national and local planning policies.

                    <p>Many advertisements and signs can be displayed without the need for consent. There are however a number of signs that require permission before they can be erected. The following link to the Department of Communities and Local Government website provides some information on the types of advertisements and signage that require express permission. <br />

                    <p>It is illegal to display a sign or advertisement without consent, or knowingly allow someone else to display a sign or advertisement without consent.

                    <p>You can view all <a href="/PLO/Default.aspx#s=sectioncontent6">Current Planning Appeals</a> and also a list of <a href="/PLO/Default.aspx#s=sectioncontent5">Planning Appeal Decisions</a>. In addition to this there is advice below about what you can do if your application is refused as well as information about planning permission conditions. </p>
                    <p><strong>What if my planning application is refused?<br />
                    </strong>If your planning application is refused and you think that the proposal could be altered to make it more acceptable it can be submitted again with different plans. In certain circumstances another application fee may not be needed. However, the proposal must be of a similar nature. If you intend to submit another application, you should discuss this with the case officer. The alternative is to appeal against the refusal by contacting the Planning Inspectorate and obtaining the necessary forms. Normally this must be submitted within 6 months of the decision, however, if the proposal is retrospective, and an enforcement notice is in place, the time limit is 28 days. </p>
                    <p>Further information on lodging an appeal can be found on the Planning Inspectorate's website: <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/appeals/appeals">http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/appeals/appeals </a></p>
                    <p><strong>Planning Permission Conditions<br />
                    </strong>Some planning permissions will be granted subject to a condition or conditions that you have to agree certain matters (e.g. building materials) with the Council before the scheme is started. This agreement must be made in writing and you should contact the Council as soon as possible and certainly before any work starts. </p>
                    <p>If you do not agree with Conditions attached to a Planning Permission, you could make another application to try and get planning permission without such conditions; however the Council will have put the conditions on for a good reason and the alternative to an unconditioned permission is likely to be a refusal of permission. </p>
                    <p>Unless circumstances have changed since the planning permission was granted it is likely that the conditions will have to remain. You should discuss this with the case officer. The alternative is to appeal against the conditions by contacting the Planning Inspectorate. <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/planninginspectorate</a></p>
