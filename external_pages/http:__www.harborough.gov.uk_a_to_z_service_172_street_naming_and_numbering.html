		<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
		<div class="lead_item">
			<h2>Street naming and numbering</h2>
			<div class="byEditor">
			<p>As from 1 January 2016, applications for street naming and numbering will be subject to a fee:</p><span>
  <ul type="disc">
   <li>Naming/Numbering of&nbsp;one&nbsp;to five&nbsp;properties:&nbsp;&pound;40 each</li>
   <li>Naming/ Numbering for more than&nbsp;five plots:&nbsp;&pound;200 for 5 properties plus &pound;25 for each additional property </li>
   <li>Naming/Numbering of new buildings of multiple occupancy: &pound;40 plus &pound;25 per unit/flat within</li>
   <li>Naming of a street:&nbsp;&pound;150 each street</li>
   <li>Changes to a development after notification:&nbsp;&pound;50 admin fee plus &pound;15 per plot</li>
   <li>Renaming/renumbering of existing single property:&nbsp;no charge</li>
   <li>Street re-naming at residents request:&nbsp;&pound;250 plus all compensation met by applicant with a two thirds majority agreement from residents </li>
   <li>Written Confirmation of postal address details:&nbsp;&pound;25</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Paying for address changes </h2>
  <p>You can&nbsp;apply&nbsp;by email to <a href="mailto:snn@harborough.gov.uk">snn@harborough.gov.uk</a></p>
  <p>At present fees can only be paid by cheque. Cheques for fees should be made payable to <a href="/contact">Harborough District Council</a>, and should be included with any documentation/plans sent to the Land and Property Data Manager. </p>
  <p>If you are unsure of the correct fee, please contact the street naming and numbering officer prior to raising the cheque. Confirmation of receipt of payment shall be made by email wherever possible.</p>
  <h2 class="text_align_left">Numbering properties </h2>
  <p>A new street should be numbered with even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other (normally left and right sides respectively) except for a cul-de-sac where consecutive numbering in a clockwise direction is preferred. Additional properties in streets that are currently numbered will always be allocated a property number. </p>
  <p>Private garages, annexes and buildings used for housing cars or livestock will not be numbered separately from a main property. </p>
  <p>A sequence will be maintained with the number 13 included. Once numbered we will not normally re-number properties. We will only re-number a property where there can be shown to be consistent delivery problems or during the course of a development. Buildings (including those on corner sites) are numbered according to the street in which the main entrance is to be found and the manipulation of numbering in order to secure a &quot;prestige&quot; address or to avoid an address will not be allowed. </p>
  <p><span><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/698/application_for_addition_or_change_of_property_namedoc">Apply for new property numbers (DOC, 921KB)</a></span>. </span></p>
  <h3>Flats and multi-occupancy buildings </h3>
  <p>In multiple occupancy buildings (blocks of flats) it is preferable to give a street number to each dwelling with individual access to the street. When the flats share a common entrance or there are not sufficient numbers available because of existing development, the building should be given a number where possible or a name, and the flats numbered separately internally. </p>
  <p>Flats will be numbered in the form of 'Flat 1', 'Flat 2', etc. Any other form of naming or numbering is discouraged (for example 'First Floor Flat' or 'Flat A' is unacceptable and will be known as 'Flat 1'). </p>
  <p>If a multiple occupancy building has entrances in more than one street, then each entrance can be numbered in the appropriate road if required. </p>
  <p><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/698/application_for_addition_or_change_of_property_namedoc">Apply for new property numbers (DOC, 921KB)</a></span>. </p>
  <h2>Naming properties </h2>
  <p>Where a property has a number, it must be used and displayed. Where a name has been given to a property with its official number the number must always be included. The name alone cannot be an alternative. </p>
  <p>The official address will be the property number and any name will be held on our database as an alternative for completeness of identification only. This applies both to domestic and commercial property. This is to ensure consistency of records over time, reduce costs and aid delivery of mail and emergency service response. </p>
  <p>Historically, some rural areas do not have a numbering sequence. Individual houses and small developments in these areas, on existing unnumbered roads, will normally require property names. Proposals for naming unnumbered properties should meet the general criteria set for Street Naming and should not repeat the road name, or that of any house of building in the area. </p>
  <p><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/698/application_for_addition_or_change_of_property_namedoc">Request a new name or to change a name (DOC, 921KB)</a></span>. </p>
  <h2>Street names for new developments with 5 properties or less </h2>
  <p>Small housing developments of 5 properties or less with private access to an existing road will be numbered off that road where possible. Where we feel it is appropriate we will agree with the developer a 'sub-road' name for the development. Any such building names should end with one of the following suffixes: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
   <li>House </li>
   <li>Court </li>
   <li>Mews </li>
   <li>Terrace </li>
   <li>View </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the case of an infill development of more than 5 units in one structure (eg terrace properties or flats) a building name&nbsp;may also&nbsp;be agreed. Any such agreed name will form part of the postal numbering and as such should be prominently displayed. </p>
  <p><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/699/new_property_addressdoc">Apply for new property numbers or names (DOC, 922KB)</a></span>. </p>
  <h2>Street names for new developments with more than 5 properties </h2>
  <p><span>After work has started on a new housing site with more than 5 properties the developers can supply 3 preferred names for consideration for each of the new streets being constructed. Street names should have some connection with the area and must conform to our <a href="/download/downloads/id/700/street_naming_and_numbering_policypdf">street naming and numbering policy (PDF, 152KB)</a>. The developer must also supply a layout plan with plot numbers with the street name application </span></p>
  <p><span>Complete an <a href="/download/downloads/id/701/street_naming_application_formdoc">application form for the naming of streets in a new development (DOC, 127KB)</a>. </span></p>
  <p>Within 5 working days of receiving the developer's 3 preferred names, and making sure they meet our policy guidelines, the relevant Ward Councillors and Parish Council will be consulted. The consultation will last for 14 days from the date of the covering letter to the Ward Councillors and Parish Council. This is a strict deadline date as there is a legally imposed time limit. </p>
  <p>If by the deadline date one of the offered names is considered acceptable by all or a majority of the consultees then that name will be adopted. The properties within the new street will be numbered and an official plan produced. The plan will be sent to the developer, Royal Mail and other relevant bodies. </p>
  <p>If no response is received from consultees by the specified 'deadline' date, then the GIS Manager will select one of the 3 preferred names, the properties within the new street will be numbered, an official plan produced and distributed. </p>
  <p>If none of the offered names are considered acceptable by the Ward Councillors and Parish Council and they have put forward their own preferred name within the deadline date the developer will be immediately informed by a written notice of objection to their preferred name. The developer will be asked to accept the name put forward by the Ward Councillors and Parish Council. If the developer declines, they have the legal right to appeal to a Magistrates' Court within 21 days of the service of the notice of objection. </p>
  <h3>Signage </h3>
  <p>Developers are responsible for the cost and installation of street nameplates. We will cover maintenance costs once the street has been officially adopted. Street nameplates must meet our specifications. </p>
  <p>Maintenance of street signs becomes our responsibility once a street has been adopted. </p>
  <p>It is not lawful to erect a street nameplate until we have confirmed the street name in writing. </p>
  <h3>Criteria for naming streets </h3>
  <p>Developers and Parish Councils should follow these guidelines for any suggested street names. </p>
  <p>New street names should not duplicate any similar name already in use in a town or village or in the same postcode area. A variation in the last word (eg &quot;street&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, or &quot;avenue&quot;) will not be accepted as reason to duplicate a name. </p>
  <p>A common request is to repeat existing names in a new road or building title (eg a request for &quot;St Mary's Close&quot; off an existing St Mary's Way, near St Mary's Church). This is not allowed as it can have a harmful effect in an emergency situation. </p>
  <p>Street names should not be difficult to pronounce, awkward to spell or names where punctuation may give rise to variations. </p>
  <p>We will not adopt any unofficial 'marketing' titles used by developers in the sale of new properties. </p>
  <p>Names will not be considered that may be construed as nationalist, obscene, racist or contravene any aspect of our Equality and Diversity Policy or would undermine the cohesiveness of local communities. </p>
  <p>Street names must not include the word &quot;The&quot; or end with a possessive (an apostrophe ‘s’) or plural words (eg &quot;The Saltings&quot;) </p>
  <p>Names that may be taken as advertising (eg a company’s name) will not be accepted </p>
  <p>All new street names should ideally end with one of the following suffixes: </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Street (for any thoroughfare) </li>
   <li>Road (for any thoroughfare) </li>
   <li>Way (for major roads) </li>
   <li>Avenue (for residential roads) </li>
   <li>Drive (for residential roads) </li>
   <li>Grove (for residential roads) </li>
   <li>Lane (for residential roads) </li>
   <li>Gardens (for residential roads) subject to there being no confusion with any local open space </li>
   <li>Place (for residential roads) </li>
   <li>Crescent (for a crescent shaped road) </li>
   <li>Close (for a cul-de-sac only) </li>
   <li>Square (for a square only) </li>
   <li>Hill (for a hillside road only) </li>
   <li>Circus (for residential roads) </li>
   <li>Vale (for residential roads, in appropriate circumstances) </li>
   <li>Rise (for residential roads, in appropriate circumstances) </li>
   <li>Row (for residential roads, in appropriate circumstances) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>All new pedestrian ways should end with one of the following suffixes: </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Walk </li>
   <li>Path </li>
   <li>Way </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The use of North, East, South or West (as in North Road and South Street) is only acceptable where the road is continuous and passes over a major junction. It is not acceptable when the road is in two separate parts with no vehicular access between the two. </p>
  <p>We will avoid having 2 phonetically similar names within a postal area and, if possible within the district eg ‘Churchill Road’ and ‘Birch Hill Road’. </p>
  <p>The use of a name that relates to people either living or those alive during living memory should be avoided if possible. Only exceptional circumstances will be given consideration and justification will be required as well as the consent of either the person concerned or their family. </p>
  <h3>Providing Postcodes </h3>
  <p>We are not responsible for issuing new postcodes. When an approved address is agreed by all parties, Royal Mail will confirm a postcode; however they will not issue a postcode for a new street or property until we request this. The maintenance and any future changes to this postcode are Royal Mail's responsibility. </p>
  <h3>Address Locality </h3>
  <p>Localities within the official postcode and post town address are the responsibility of Royal Mail. Applicants objecting to a post town in their postal address, must speak to Royal Mail who have a procedure laid down in their code of practice by the Postal Services Commission for adding or amending the details. </p></span>			</div>
