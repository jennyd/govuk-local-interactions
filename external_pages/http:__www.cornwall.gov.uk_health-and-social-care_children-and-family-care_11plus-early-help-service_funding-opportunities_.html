<h2>Paul Hamlyn Foundation £150m grant scheme opens up to youth work</h2>
<p>Youth organisations will be able to apply for cash to support their work as part of a £150m grant scheme.  The Paul Hamlyn Foundation has launched grant funds specifically intended to support youth work for the first time. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Paul Hamlyn Foundation (web page opens in a new window)">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a> (PHF) has said that its grant scheme, worth £25m a year until 2021, will be accessible to youth work organisations for the first time.</p>
<p>As part of the organisation’s six strategic priorities, it wants to “support the development and growth of organisations investing in young people and positive change”.</p>
<p>To this end, youth work organisations will have access to two new funds – a <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/funds/youth-fund/" target="_blank" title="PHF Youth Fund (web page opens in a new window)">Youth Fund</a> and a <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/programmes/growth-fund/" target="_blank" title="PHF Growth Fund (web page opens in a new window)">Growth Fund</a>.</p>
<p>The Youth Fund, which will provide funding of between £10,000 and £60,000, is intended to help organisations by covering a proportion of core operating costs. “This is a direct response to feedback – that in order to achieve greatest positive impact in the lives of young people, organisations need to achieve a balance of stability, continuity and flexibility,” the organisation's strategy document for 2015 to 2021 states.</p>
<p>The foundation said it expects to make up to 30 awards a year through the fund.  The Growth Fund will provide funding and support to help organisations identify and implement practical steps to growth.  It will be launched later this year and is by invitation only.</p>
<p>Other funds being run by the foundation include the <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/funds/shared-ground-fund/" target="_blank" title="PHF Shared Growth Fund (web page opens in a new window)">Shared Ground Fund</a>, which will provide support to help explore new approaches to assisting young migrants in need, and two art funds intended to enrich young people’s lives and education through art.</p>
<p>Moira Sinclair, chief executive of the foundation, said: “PHF’s mission remains ambitious and has never been more relevant.</p>
<p>“At a time of continued austerity and significant social and economic challenges, trusts and foundations can play a vital role in supporting innovation, and backing people with game-changing ideas, as well as providing long-term support and funding.</p>
<p>“Most importantly, our focus must be on helping people, especially young people, overcome disadvantage and realise their full potential.”</p>

<p>Priority is given to charities that the trustees have previously worked with. However, a number of charities are added to the Trust’s grant funding portfolio each year. For these new applications, The Trust focuses on a particular theme and this changes from year to year.</p>
<p>The Trust’s current theme is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting innovative education or training projects that benefit disadvantaged young people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications are accepted from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charities that are UK registered (although they can operate anywhere in the world);</li>
<li>Smaller charities where the impact of the Trust’s funding has a greater impact and is less likely to become lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications for 2015 will be accepted from Saturday 1 August and must be made via the Trust’s online application form.</p>

<p>The organisation has a creative team which specialises in all things media, so the young people have the chance to create powerful resources such as music videos, books, flyers, poster campaigns , training days,  theatre pieces, short films or adverts. These resources are used to further the project’s aims and are often used by various organisations as an educational resource.  See <a href="http://www.fixers.org.uk" target="_blank" title="Fixers (web page opens in a new window)">www.fixers.org.uk</a>  for more details of young people’s work. A Fixers project not only benefits the wider community but also leads to an increase in confidence and self-esteem amongst the young people taking part, through the development of their social and personal skills.</p>
<p>Fixers is funded by the National Lottery and is offered to organisations and young people with no cost and includes a project budget and mentorship for young people involved.</p>

<p>Youth organisations will be able to apply for cash to support their work as part of a £150m grant scheme.  The Paul Hamlyn Foundation has launched grant funds specifically intended to support youth work for the first time. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Paul Hamlyn Foundation (web page opens in a new window)">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a> (PHF) has said that its grant scheme, worth £25m a year until 2021, will be accessible to youth work organisations for the first time.</p>
<p>As part of the organisation’s six strategic priorities, it wants to “support the development and growth of organisations investing in young people and positive change”.</p>
<p>To this end, youth work organisations will have access to two new funds – a <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/funds/youth-fund/" target="_blank" title="PHF Youth Fund (web page opens in a new window)">Youth Fund</a> and a <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/programmes/growth-fund/" target="_blank" title="PHF Growth Fund (web page opens in a new window)">Growth Fund</a>.</p>
<p>The Youth Fund, which will provide funding of between £10,000 and £60,000, is intended to help organisations by covering a proportion of core operating costs. “This is a direct response to feedback – that in order to achieve greatest positive impact in the lives of young people, organisations need to achieve a balance of stability, continuity and flexibility,” the organisation's strategy document for 2015 to 2021 states.</p>
<p>The foundation said it expects to make up to 30 awards a year through the fund.  The Growth Fund will provide funding and support to help organisations identify and implement practical steps to growth.  It will be launched later this year and is by invitation only.</p>
<p>Other funds being run by the foundation include the <a href="http://www.phf.org.uk/funds/shared-ground-fund/" target="_blank" title="PHF Shared Growth Fund (web page opens in a new window)">Shared Ground Fund</a>, which will provide support to help explore new approaches to assisting young migrants in need, and two art funds intended to enrich young people’s lives and education through art.</p>
<p>Moira Sinclair, chief executive of the foundation, said: “PHF’s mission remains ambitious and has never been more relevant.</p>
<p>“At a time of continued austerity and significant social and economic challenges, trusts and foundations can play a vital role in supporting innovation, and backing people with game-changing ideas, as well as providing long-term support and funding.</p>
<p>“Most importantly, our focus must be on helping people, especially young people, overcome disadvantage and realise their full potential.”</p>

<p>West Country based the <a href="http://esender.cosmic.org.uk/t/r-l-qkkuikt-iueikudhu-o/" target="_blank" title="GC Gibson (web page opens in a new window)">GC Gibson Charitable Trust</a> was established in 1968 by George Gibson by a grant of shares in his shipping business, based in Cardiff, called Atlantic Shipping.</p>
<p>The fund today is worth £12 million and invests in quoted equities aiming to grow its capital and yet provide a income which is paid out annually in small grants to around 200 charities.</p>
<p>The GC Gibson Charity offers grants of between £1,000 and £10,000 to a wide range of small and medium sized charities operating in the UK.  Funding is often provided for many years and the trustees put no restrictions on expenditure. During the financial year ending 31 March 2014 the Trust allocated £566,844, a slight decrease on the previous year’s allocation of £619,600.</p>
<p>Priority is given to charities that the trustees have previously worked with. However, a number of charities are added to the Trust’s grant funding portfolio each year. For these new applications, The Trust focuses on a particular theme and this changes from year to year.</p>
<p>The Trust’s current theme is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting innovative education or training projects that benefit disadvantaged young people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications are accepted from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charities that are UK registered (although they can operate anywhere in the world);</li>
<li>Smaller charities where the impact of the Trust’s funding has a greater impact and is less likely to become lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications for 2015 will be accepted from Saturday 1 August and must be made via the Trust’s online application form.</p>

Fixers works with young adults aged 16-25 to create projects which take on any issue that they are passionate about ‘fixing’.  Fixers helps groups of young people to find a creative way to make a positive change within their local or global community.</p>
<p>The organisation has a creative team which specialises in all things media, so the young people have the chance to create powerful resources such as music videos, books, flyers, poster campaigns , training days,  theatre pieces, short films or adverts. These resources are used to further the project’s aims and are often used by various organisations as an educational resource.  See <a href="http://www.fixers.org.uk" target="_blank" title="Fixers (web page opens in a new window)">www.fixers.org.uk</a>  for more details of young people’s work. A Fixers project not only benefits the wider community but also leads to an increase in confidence and self-esteem amongst the young people taking part, through the development of their social and personal skills.</p>
<p>Fixers is funded by the National Lottery and is offered to organisations and young people with no cost and includes a project budget and mentorship for young people involved.</p>

<p>Youth Engagement Fund which aims to support young people at risk of becoming NEET - The £16m Youth Engagement Fund  will help disadvantaged young people aged 14 to 17 to participate and succeed in education or training, improving their employability, reducing their long term dependency on benefits, and reducing their likelihood of offending. Jointly funded between the Cabinet Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Justice, the fund aims to support up to 18,000 young people in over 100 schools in England.</p>
<p>The funding will be delivered through social impact bonds (SIBs), an innovative way of solving complex social problems. SIBs are a payment by results system and will see investors fund innovative projects to prevent young people from becoming NEET, with government only paying if the projects are successful.</p>
<p>The prospectus provides further details on the aims and structure of the fund and the bidding process. We aim to open the fund to initial applications from partnerships in early July when we will publish full bidding documentation and will also hold bidder information events. In the meantime we are encouraging people to start conversations with potential partners in your area and also to register their interest in the Youth Engagement Fund by emailing <a href="mailto:yef@cabinet-office.gsi.gov.uk" title="Email the youth engagement fund">yef@cabinet-office.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>
