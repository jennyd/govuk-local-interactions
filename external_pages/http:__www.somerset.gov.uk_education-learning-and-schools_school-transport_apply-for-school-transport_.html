Transport is provided to primary and secondary schools, special schools, schools affiliated to a faith, further educational establishments/colleges and pupil referral units. We may be able to help some children who don't qualify for free school transport by offering a spare seat on a vehicle on a paying basis. Please use the apply now button below if you think you are entitled to free transport. If you are interested in transport on a paying basis see the page <br /> <a class="oLinkInternal" title="Request school transport on a paying basis." href="/education-learning-and-schools/school-transport/request-school-transport-on-a-paying-basis/">Request school transport on a paying basis</a>.</p> <p> <a target="_blank" class="oLinkFile" title="Apply for school transport" href="https://secure1.somerset.gov.uk/forms/PortalShowForm.asp?fm_formalias=SchoolTransport">Apply now</a> <br />     <br /> <strong>Please note</strong> - where 'transport area' is referred to this is defined as the school catchment areas as at September 2012. <br />     <br /> <strong>The raising of the participation age<br /> </strong>Please note that the government has passed a new law which requires young people to participate in education and training once they have finished their compulsory secondary education - a quick guide can be found here: </p> <p> <a target="_blank" class="oLinkExternal" title="Dept for Education website" href="http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/youngpeople/participation/rpa">Raising the participation age (RPA)</a> <br />     <br />The new law does not increase the statutory school leaving age. Only young people of statutory school age (aged 4 - 15 on 1st September 2013) are eligible for free school transport, subject to our transport policy.<br />     <br />If transport to school or college for a year 12 or 13 pupil is required please select one of the related pages using the links on the right.<br />     <br />We will assess your application for school transport once we have received confirmation from the school that your child has been granted a place.<br />     <br />There are some discretionary grounds upon which transport will be provided in exceptional circumstances (for example, medical or social need) although there is very strict criteria. Please put your request in writing for consideration.<br />     <br /> <strong>Who can use it?<br /> </strong>Free school transport is provided to children between the ages of 4 and 16 years old who attend their nearest school or the school in the transport area for their home address, and who live over the statutory walking distance from that school. This is two miles for children aged under eight years old and three miles for children aged eight years old and over. It is also provided to children attending a pupil referral unit, providing the distance criteria is met and in some cases for children with a statement up to the age of 19, attending a maintained special school.<br />     <br /> <strong>Special Educational Needs<br /> </strong>We provide transport assistance for students aged 16 to 19 years old with special educational needs, such as a physical or mental disability, who cannot make their own way to their further educational establishment. Transport is provided to students who cannot live independently or in lodgings to be nearer their college and who cannot be conveyed by their parents or carers.<br />     <br />When we receive an application from a student with special educational needs going to a college, we consider the following criteria in order to reach a decision about transport provision: </p> <ul>     <li>         <p>Whether the student is applying for transport to their nearest relevant further educational establishment offering their chosen or comparable course; </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>whether the student can use a public service vehicle (the lack of a public service vehicle is not in itself a reason for individual transport to be provided); </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>whether the student is a Somerset resident; </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>the age and needs of the student and the benefits they will get from the course; and </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>the length of the journey. <br />         </p>     </li> </ul> <p>We will also consider applications for transport from students with special educational needs aged 19 to 21 years old and, in exceptional circumstances, from students over the age of 21.<br />     <br /> <strong>Low income families<br /> </strong>For children from low income families, free school transport is available under certain circumstances: <br /> </p> <ul>     <li>Children aged between 8 and 11 will receive transport to their nearest school if it is between 2 and 3 miles. </li>     <li>Children aged between 11 and 16 who live between 2 and 6 miles from the school and attend one of the three nearest schools will receive free school transport. </li> </ul> <p>For these purposes, middle schools are classified as a primary school and a low income is defined as any child who qualifies for pupil premium funding or families receiving their maximum level of Working Tax Credit.<br />     <br />Entitlement to pupil premium funding is defined as;</p> <ul>     <li>         <p>Income Support </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>The Guarantee element of State Pension Credit </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>Child Tax Credit, provided you are not entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual income (as assessed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs) that does not exceed £16,190. <br />         </p>     </li> </ul> <p>We regularly review benefit information to make sure your child still qualifies for reduced rate or free transport.<br />     <br /> <strong>Tea Visits<br /> </strong>If your child uses school transport and invites a friend home for tea who does not travel on the same bus as your child, unfortunately, the friend would not be able to travel on the bus for safety and insurance purposes.<br />     <br /> <strong>How do I use it?<br /> </strong>If your child is starting school for the first time or transferring schools in September, we will notify you of your child's eligibility to transport in your school place outcome letter. This is sent out on 1 March for secondary and upper school places and 16 April for starting school, junior and middle school places.<br />     <br />For transport at other times please ring Somerset Direct to make an application over the phone.<br />     <br />If your child has an Education, Health and Care Plan (previously known as a statement of special educational needs) please contact your casework officer to apply for transport.<br />     <br />If you are applying for school transport under religious grounds we also require a priest, minister or equivalent, to certify your active participation in the same religion or faith as the school you have chosen. A form is available to download and complete (please see Information and resources).<br />     <br />To apply for transport assistance to a further educational establishment on the grounds of special educational needs please download an application form (see Information and resources). Application forms are also available from sixth form schools and colleges. The application form needs to be completed with assistance from and signed by the sixth form school or college.<br />     <br />If your child is attending a pupil referral unit, the unit will contact us to apply for transport.<br />     <br /> <strong>What happens next?<br /> </strong>When your application form or request for transport has been assessed, we will let you know if your child is eligible for school transport. We will inform you of the transport arrangements and we will send you a bus pass for your child (if applicable).<br />     <br />If you have been informed in your secondary or upper school place outcome letter that your child is eligible for transport from September then your child's travel arrangements will be notified to you before the end of the current academic year.<br />     <br />Passes will be issued within six weeks of the start of the academic year. Passes will be delivered to the school who will distribute to all new pupils. Until all passes are delivered all Operator's have been instructed not to refuse travel. The pass will expire at the end of the pupil's time at the school and should be retained for travel in future academic years. If passes are lost or stolen, a replacement must be obtained from Transporting Somerset at a charge of £10 to cover administration costs. Replacement passes will be issued to the school upon receipt of the £10 administration fee. If the pass needs to be replaced due to wear and tear, please take it to the school office and they will contact Transporting Somerset to arrange for a free replacement pass. Until the replacement pass is received, pupils should obtain a temporary pass from the school office to ensure that they are not refused travel by the driver at the end of the day. Passes should be carried at all times, even if the driver does not check them on a daily basis, as spot checks will be carried out.<br />     <br />Please see the page <a class="oLinkInternal" title="Request a replacement school bus pass." href="/roads-parking-and-transport/public-transport/request-a-replacement-school-bus-pass/">Request a Replacement School Bus Pass</a> for more information.<br />     <br />If your child isn't eligible for school transport we will tell you why. We will give you information about any spare seats available on our school transport network that your child could use on a paying basis.<br />     <br />If your child's transport is provided on the grounds of special educational needs, we will contact you by telephone and carry out a risk assessment with you to clarify any needs that should be taken into consideration. We will then notify you of the transport arrangements.<br />     <br />If your child is eligible for transport assistance to a school on the grounds of religion or belief, we will contact you regarding the cost of transport and the transport options available.<br />     <br /> <strong>What is covered?<br /> </strong>In most cases the transport arrangements allow your child to travel from the agreed pick up/drop off point, to and from school at the start and end of the school day. If your child is travelling to and from a pupil referral unit, the transport is provided according to their specific timetable.<br />     <br />For most students with special educational needs travelling to and from a college, transport is provided at the beginning and end of the college day, however individual needs and timetables will be considered.<br />     <br /> <strong>How much does it cost?<br /> </strong>Transport is provided free of charge:</p> <ul>     <li>         <p>to eligible pupils travelling to a school; </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>to eligible pupils travelling to a pupil referral unit; </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>to pupils travelling under exceptional grounds as stated in the school transport policy; and </p>     </li>     <li>         <p>to eligible students with special educational needs attending a college. <br />         </p>     </li> </ul> <p>For pupils attending a school on the grounds of faith or belief parents are expected to pay a contribution for transport each year. This fee is not applied if proof the child is from a low income family can be supplied. The criteria for this are defined above under the heading 'Who can use it?'<br />     <br />It is your responsibility as a parent or carer to ensure that your child gets to and from the pick up/drop off point safely. You are also responsible for your child whilst waiting for the transport to arrive and after they have left the vehicle at the end of the school day. The pick up/drop off point may be up to half a mile from the home for a child under the age of 8 years old and up to <br />1 mile from the home for children over the age of 8 years old. If the pick up/drop off point is further away than the recommended distance, we will offer you a petrol allowance to transport your child to and from the bus stop.<br />     <br />For children who receive school transport from their home address, usually for children with an Education, Health and Care Plan (previously known as a Statement of Special Educational Needs) or on medical grounds, a parent or carer must be at home in order to receive their child from the school transport in the afternoon.<br />     <br />We ask that all children are waiting at the bus stop 5 minutes before the vehicle is due to arrive. We also ask that children wait for 20 minutes after the bus is due, in case the vehicle has been delayed due to traffic. We always try to advise parents of any delays that we know about.<br />     <br />If your child misses the arranged transport in the morning you will need to make your own arrangements to get your child to school. If your child attends an after school club or is unable to use the transport at the end of the normal school day you will need to make your own arrangements to get your child home. This includes after school detentions. Even if your child travels on their own in a taxi, you will still need to make your own arrangements if your child is staying late at school, as we only schedule transport at the end of the normal school day. If your child uses a public service vehicle, their bus pass may allow them to travel at a later time than the normal end of school day.<br />     <br />If transport is unable to run due to adverse weather conditions and you are able to transport your own child to school, it is your responsibility to collect your child from school at the end of the day. A list of routes affected by severe weather can be found on our <br /> <a class="oLinkInternal" title="Transport affected by bad weather." href="/roads-parking-and-transport/public-transport/transport-affected-by-bad-weather/">Transport affected by bad weather</a> page. <br />     <br />We aim for a maximum length of journey of approximately 45 minutes each way for primary age children and 1 hour and 15 minutes each way for middle or secondary age children unless they are travelling to a special school outside Somerset.<br />     <br />If your child has left their belongings on their school bus, please contact the operator of the transport.<br />     <br /> </p> <p> <strong><a title="Blake-Science-College" id="Blake-Science-College">Important school transport information for parents and carers of students attending Robert Blake Science College who live in the North Petherton area.</a></strong></p> <p> <span style="font-size: 13.6px">Following a recent request from a parent for the route from North Petherton to Robert Blake Science College to be assessed under road safety grounds, we are now able to advise parents and carers of a change to entitlement. Whilst the route to the school is paved, the volume of traffic at one of the crossing points exceeds the recommended level. Therefore, this small section of the route has now been classed as unsuitable to walk and cross. This means that students living in North Petherton will now be entitled to free school transport to Robert Blake Science College until road improvements are made to ensure the route is re-designated as safe. </span>    <br /> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 13.6px">However, work is due to begin on the walking and cycling route from North Petherton to Bridgwater. When these works are complete it may be the case that your child will no longer be eligible for free home to school travel assistance, as there may be a safe route to school that is under the statutory walking distance of 2 miles for children aged under 8 years old and 3 miles for children aged 8 years old and over. Work is currently estimated to be completed by December 2015 and if as a result, your child will no longer be entitled to free home to school travel assistance, you will be given half a term’s notice of these arrangements.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 13.6px">Parents and carers will need to apply for school transport <a class="oLinkInternal" title="School transport" href="/roads-parking-and-transport/school-transport/school-transport/">online</a> or by phoning Somerset Direct on 0300 123 2224.
