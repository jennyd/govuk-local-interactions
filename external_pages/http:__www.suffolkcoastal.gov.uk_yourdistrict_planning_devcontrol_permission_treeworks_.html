		<p>Formal consent needs to be obtained from the Council to fell or prune a protected tree and notification must be given of proposed works to <a href="yourdistrict/planning/devcontrol/permission/treeworks/#carea">trees in conservation areas</a>.</p>
<p>There are some exemptions where trees are dead, dying or  dangerous but we still need to be informed; replacement tree planting is usually  required where trees are felled or die.</p>
<p>Many trees are protected by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs). These have normally arisen from the need to protect trees from development pressure, many date back to the 1950’s but new TPOs continue to be served.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/yourdistrict/planning/devcontrol/gis/tpoguide/">view the location of TPOs</a> using our online geographical information system (GIS).</p>
<p>For more information on the location of TPOs and advice about carrying out works on trees protected by Tree Preservation Orders contact the Arboricultural Officer on <strong>01394 444241</strong> or email <a href="mailto:d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Tree works application form</h2>
<p>Applications for works to trees subject to a preservation order must be made  on the form which you can download or print off by following the link below:</p>
<ul><li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/appPDF/J3530Form031_england_en.pdf" target="_blank">Application form (PDF 552KB)</a></li>
<li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/appPDF/Help031_england_en.pdf" target="_blank">Form guidance notes (PDF 102KB)</a></li>
<li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="assets/Documents/District/Planning-DM/Validation/Checklists-A/TreeWorks2web.pdf" target="_blank">Validation checklist (PDF 204KB)</a></li>
</ul><p>You can also <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/">submit  an online application to the Council</a> via the Planning  Portal.</p>
<h2>Tree Preservation Orders - changes from April 2012</h2>
<p>The laws relating to the preservation of trees changed on 6 April 2012. The  Department of Communities and Local Government have produced guides which  provide information on the changes that have taken place:</p>
<ul><li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="assets/Documents/District/Countryside/Trees/TPOMainChangesApril2012.pdf" target="_blank">Main changes to the tree preservation order system in England from  6 April 2012 (PDF 76KB)</a></li>
<li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="assets/Documents/District/Countryside/Trees/ProtectedtreesaguidetoTPOproceduresMay2012.pdf" target="_blank">Protected trees - a guide to tree preservation procedures (PDF 89KB)</a></li>
</ul><p>The changes are based upon the proposals that the Government consulted on in  September 2010. The new regulations will not reduce the level of tree protection  but will make the tree preservation order system simpler for local authorities  to administer and easier to understand and fairer for tree  owners.</p>
<h2>Notification of proposed works to trees in conservation areas<a name="carea"> </a></h2>
<p>Conservation areas are designated by local planning authorities  to protect the character of historic towns and villages - the buildings, trees  and landscape. Trees in <a href="/yourdistrict/planning/designandconservation/conservationareas/">conservation areas</a> are afforded protection. Written  notification to fell or prune a tree in a conservation area has to be given to  the Council, we then have 6 weeks to consider the proposal. A TPO could be  served if the tree is considered to be of significant amenity value.</p>
<p>You can use the application for tree works form to notify the Council of  proposed works to trees in conservation areas which you can download or print  off by following the link below:</p>
<ul><li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/appPDF/J3530Form031_england_en.pdf" target="_blank">Application form (PDF 552KB)</a></li>
<li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/appPDF/Help031_england_en.pdf" target="_blank">Form guidance notes (PDF 102KB)</a></li>
<li><a title="Opens in a new window" href="assets/Documents/District/Planning-DM/Validation-2014/ValidationChecklistForFormYv2.pdf" target="_blank">Validation checklist (PDF 204KB)</a></li>
</ul><p><strong>For trees in conservation areas only</strong> - the Council will  still accept six weeks written notice of precisely specified intended works  which must be accompanied by a plan which clearly shows the trees to be worked  on and their location.</p>
<p>For more information about trees in conservation areas contact the  Arboricultural Officer on <strong>01394 444241</strong> or email <a href="mailto:d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Weekly lists of tree works registered and decided</h2>
<p>Details of applications for tree works are available on the Council's planning system called Public Access. To view weekly lists of applications use the 'Week Beginning' drop-down list to select which week you wish to view, then click 'Search'.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://planningpublicaccess.waveney.gov.uk/online-applications/search.do;jsessionid=05899DC1E69E4B11099066310380F772?action=weeklyList">Search for tree works applications on Public Access</a></li>
</ul><p>While the whole list will show applications from both Suffolk Coastal and Waveney districts, the filter option can be used to only return information for a specific town, parish or ward if that is what is required.</p>
<h2>Trees on development sites</h2>
<p>On sites where there are trees subject to preservation orders, within  conservation areas or where there are important amenity, landscape, landmark or  heritage trees, a tree survey (location, species, dimensions) and tree condition  report incorporating <a href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030213642">BS5837:2012 Trees in relation to construction</a> will be required when an application for planning permission is made.</p>
<p>As well as the trees, the survey must indicate key landscape features such as  ponds, hedges and wildlife corridors that may be affected by the proposed  development. Trees to be felled and trees to be retained should be clearly  delineated. The information should provide details of tree and hedge protection,  for those retained, in accordance with BS5837.</p>
<p>Please also see the guidance <a title="Opens in a new window" href="assets/Documents/District/Countryside/Trees/TreeProtectionGuidanceNote1.pdf" target="_blank">Protection of trees on development sites (PDF  168KB)</a>.</p>
<p>For larger applications it will also be appropriate to provide details of the  landscape strategy for the site, including indications of new planting.</p>
<p>An arboricultural method statement should be provided that sets out the  information regarding the measures to be taken to protect the trees shown to be  retained on the submitted drawings, schedules of any necessary tree work and  proposals for long-term maintenance.</p>
<p>Please contact the Arboricultural Officer if you would like further  information or if you see trees on development sites being damaged or felled.  Call <strong>01394 444241</strong> or email <a href="mailto:d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>Tree planting and aftercare</h2>
<p>The enhancement of the green environment is essential to the well-being of  its inhabitants. Trees, shrubs and hedges can provide shelter, shade, homes for  wildlife, fuel, decoration, pollution control and beauty. The Council promotes  the planting of new trees, hedges and shrubs on new developments and on open  space where opportunities arise. We encourage residents to care for trees and  hedges that have been planted in their own gardens by developers.</p>
<p>There are usually opportunities for tree planting within private gardens  where it is important to choose the right tree, the right space and to manage  the tree carefully when planted.</p>
<p>We have produced the following guidance notes which are available from the  Arboricultural Officer:</p>
<ul><li>Planting and caring for new trees.</li>
<li>Trees &amp; hedges - planting and aftercare.</li>
</ul><p>Further information may be obtained from the <a href="http://www.trees.org.uk/">Arboricultural Association</a>.</p>
<h2>Information and advice</h2>
<p>For more information on any of the subjects covered above, advice on tree  management or copies of our guidance notes please contact the  Arboricultural Officer on <strong>01394 444241</strong> or email <a href="mailto:d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">d.c.admin@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
