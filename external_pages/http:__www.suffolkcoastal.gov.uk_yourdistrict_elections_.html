</ul><p>Suffolk Coastal has a total population of over 127,000 people, of which over 94,000 are eligible to vote. Our elections team is responsible for  maintaining the electoral register for the Suffolk Coastal district.</p>
<h2>Who can register to vote?<a name="who"> </a></h2>
<p>You have to be 18 or older to vote. You can register to vote when you are  16.</p>
<p>People who are entitled to vote in elections in the UK:</p>
<ul><li class="bulletheight">British citizens.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">Citizens of the Irish Republic.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">Citizens of other European Union countries - EU citizens will be registered  as local government electors only (except citizens of Cyprus, Malta and the  Irish Republic, who can vote in all elections). For more information about  registering to vote in European Parliamentary elections, please contact us on  <strong>01394 444422</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">Qualifying Commonwealth citizens - this means Commonwealth citizens who have  leave to enter or remain in the UK or do not require such leave.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">Citizens of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or a British Overseas  Territory living in the UK.</li>
</ul><p>Follow this link for a full list of the <a href="/yourdistrict/elections/register/nationalities/#services">nationalities entitled to register to vote</a> in  elections in the UK.</p>
<p>You can register only for the address where you are resident. Students may  register <strong>at both</strong> their home and college addresses.</p>
<p>Second home owners are able to register if they make a declaration stating  that they spend an average of 2 to 3 days a week at their second home.</p>
<h2>Why should I register?<a name="why"> </a></h2>
<ul><li class="bulletheight">If you do not register then you cannot exercise your democratic right to  vote in any election.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">It is much harder to obtain credit if you are not on the register.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">The Council may take legal proceedings against householders who fail to  return their registration form.</li>
</ul><h2>How do I get my name on the electoral register?<a name="how"> </a></h2>
<p>Individual Electoral Registration (IER) has been introduced in England and Wales. Any new application to register to vote now has to be made individually. With IER, for the first time, you can register online - this is the simplest and quickest way to register.</p>
<ul><li class="bulletheight">Register online at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">www.gov.uk/register-to-vote</a></li>
</ul><p>In order to apply, you will need to provide your National Insurance Number and date of birth. Remember that each person over 18 in the household will need to apply individually.</p>
<p>You can also apply on a paper form which we will send to you pre-filled with the information we already know - just call us on <strong>01394 444422</strong> or email <a href="mailto:elections.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">elections.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>The electoral register and the open register<a name="what"> </a></h2>
<p>Registration officers keep two registers - the electoral register and the open register (also known as the edited register).</p>
<ul><li class="bulletheight"><strong>The electoral register</strong> lists the names and addresses of everybody who is registered to vote in public elections.</li>
<li class="bulletheight"><strong>The open register</strong> is an extract of the electoral register, but is not used for elections. It can be bought by any person, company or organisation.</li>
</ul><p>Every person applying to become registered is asked to choose whether to have their details excluded from the open register.</p>
<p>Any elector can email us at <a href="mailto:optout.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">optout.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a> at any time to ask us to remove their details from the open register. You will need to specify your name and address and that you want your details excluded from it.</p>
<p>Exclusion from the open register will not affect your voting rights or credit status.</p>
<p>Follow this link for <a href="/yourdistrict/elections/electoralandopenregisters/">more about about the electoral and open registers</a>.</p>
<h2>How can I view the register?<a name="view"> </a></h2>
<p>The electoral register can be checked at our Woodbridge offices. However, anyone checking it must be supervised  and they may only make hand written notes. Anyone wishing to make an extended  search should telephone <strong>01394 444422</strong> to make appropriate  arrangements.</p>
<p>A copy of the open register is available for inspection at the reception  desk at our <a href="/contactus/map/">Woodbridge offices</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I know when to vote?<a name="when"> </a></h2>
<p>Approximately three weeks before an election each member of the household who  is eligible to vote should receive either:</p>
<ul><li class="bulletheight">A poll card informing them about the date of the election, where their  polling station is and the hours of the poll and how to vote. You do not need to  take the poll card with you to be able to vote.</li>
<li class="bulletheight">Information about their postal or proxy voting arrangements and what to do  if these need to be changed.</li>
</ul><p>If neither document is received, it may be that you are not on the electoral  register. You can register to vote by contacting us on <strong>01394 444422</strong> or emailing <a href="mailto:elections.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">elections.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a> and we will send you a partially completed form ready for your signature.</p>
<h2>Voting by post or proxy<a name="post"> </a></h2>
<table style="width: 100%;" border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #add8e6;">
<p>Individual Electoral Registration (IER) has been introduced in England and Wales. Anyone wishing to vote by post or proxy at the May 2015 General Election has to be registered under IER. Most people automatically transferred to the IER register and kept their post or proxy votes without having to do anything further.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>There are three different ways you can vote. Many people vote in person at a  polling station. However, if you don't want to go the polling station in person  on election day or you are not able to, you can apply to vote by post or by  proxy (someone voting on your behalf).</p>
<p>If you want to apply to vote by post or by proxy, contact us on <strong>01394 444422</strong> or email <a href="mailto:elections.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">elections.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a> and we can send you a partially completed form ready for your signature.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can go to the <a href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/">aboutmyvote website</a> to complete or download an  application form, which you'll need to print off, sign and send to us at the  address below.</p>
<p>Postal votes are usually sent out about two weeks before election day. Once  you’ve got it, mark your vote on the ballot paper (or ballot papers if there is  more than one election taking place in your area) and send it back to us as soon as possible but make sure we receive it by close of poll or your vote won’t be  counted.</p>
<p>If you miss the post, you can drop off your postal vote at the return address  shown on envelope B by 10pm on polling day. Or you can take it to any polling  station in your electoral area between 7am and 10pm on polling day.</p>
