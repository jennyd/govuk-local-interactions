<h2>Challenging
Council Tax Support decisions </h2> 
  <p>If you disagree with a decision on your Council Tax Support claim you can
ask for it to be explained or looked at again. </p> 
  <p><span>It is unlikely that a decision will be changed if your Council Tax Support
has been awarded correctly according to <a href="/directory_record/484/council_tax_support_scheme_details">our local scheme</a>. </span></p> 
  <p>However you can challenge the amount of Council Tax you have to pay for any
of the reasons below : </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>You think that under the local Council Tax Support &nbsp;scheme we should have given you a reduction on the council tax
 you pay but has not done this </li> 
    <li>You think that the amount of reduction we have given you under our local scheme is incorrect </li> 
    <li>You think that a decision on your application for a
 Discretionary Discount Fund payment is wrong </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/429/appeals_-_dispute_formpdf">Ask us to look at a decision again (PDF, 105KB)</a></span>.</p> 
  <h3>When we review your
Council Tax Support claim </h3> 
  <p>If you have asked for the decision to be looked at again we will do this
and then we will write to you: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>If we find that an unlawful decision has been made we
will change it </li> 
    <li>If we cannot change the decision we will explain why we
were unable to change it </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><span>If you still disagree with the decision after it has been looked at again,
or 2 months have passed since you asked for it to be looked at again and you
have not received a reply, you can <a href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/Home.aspx">appeal directly to an independent
organisation called the Valuation Tribunal</a>.</span></p> 
  <p>The Valuation Tribunal will only be able to make sure the Council Tax
Support decision has been made correctly according to the local scheme. </p> 
  <h2>Challenging Housing Benefit decisions </h2> 
  <p>When you apply for Housing Benefit we will give you a decision in writing
about your claim. If you disagree with it you can: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li><a href="/benefit-appeals#explain">Ask us to explain our decision</a></li> 
    <li><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/429/appeals_-_dispute_formpdf">Ask us to look at a decision again (PDF, 105KB)</a></span></li> 
    <li><a href="/benefit-appeals#tribunal">Appeal against our decision to an independent
 tribunal</a></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>You can ask us to look again at any decision you think is wrong. However
there are some decisions you cannot appeal against: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>How often we pay you and by what method </li> 
    <li>How we recover an amount we overpaid you </li> 
    <li>Any figure laid down in law, such as the capital
 limit (£16,000&nbsp;is the&nbsp;upper capital limit - this limit does not apply to Pension Credit guarantee cases)</li> 
    <li>The level of Local Housing Allowance or the Broad
 Market Area on which it is based</li> 
    <li><span>If you think our decision about a<em><strong> </strong></em><a href="/benefits-help">Discretionary
 Housing Payment </a></span>is wrong </li> 
    <li><span>A decision to apply the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap">benefit cap advised by
 the Department for Works and Pensions</a></span></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If you would like independent advice you can get help from your local <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice bureau. </a> </p> 
  <h3 id="explain">Explaining our
decision </h3> 
  <p>You can <a href="/download/downloads/id/429/appeals_-_dispute_formpdf">ask us to give you a statement in writing to explain how we made
our decision (PDF, 105KB)</a>. </p> 
  <p>You must do this within 1 month from the date on the decision letter. </p> 
  <p>If there are special circumstances which mean you cannot write to us within
1 month, you must contact us to explain why, because we may still be able to
look at our decision again. </p> 
  <p>If your request is not received within 13 months of the decision letter the
law says that we cannot look at the decision again. </p> 
  <h3>Reviewing your
claim </h3> 
  <p>When you ask us to look at your benefit claim again we will check to see if
it is correct. </p> 
  <p>If we can change our decision: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>We may change it from the date of our original
 decision</li> 
    <li>We will send you a letter explaining our new
 decision </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If we cannot change our decision: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>We will send you a letter explaining why </li> 
    <li>You will have one more month to appeal to the
 Tribunal Service </li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3 id="tribunal">Appeal a decision
at a tribunal </h3> 
  <p>You can <a href="/download/downloads/id/444/appeal_a_decision_form">appeal against our decision on your Housing
Benefit claim to an independent tribunal (PDF, 104KB)</a>. </p> 
  <p>If you ask for an appeal (your appeal will go to a first tier tribunal) it
will be sent to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/sscs">Tribunals
Service</a>. </p> 
  <p>It will be heard by an independent tribunal made up of people that do not
work for the council. </p> 
  <p>When you request an appeal it is important that you give all the reasons
why you think our decision is wrong as the tribunal does not have to look at
anything that you do not mention. </p> 
  <p>We will send your appeal and an explanation of the law, and facts used to
make the decision to the Tribunal Service. You will also receive a form with
this information. You must complete the form and send it to the Tribunal
Service within 14 days of the date the form was sent to you. You should also
include any information which might help your case. If you do not return the
form, your appeal will stop. </p> 
  <h3>How your appeal will be heard </h3> 
  <p>The tribunal can only look at the evidence, the law and the circumstances
at the time we made the decision you are appealing against. </p> 
  <p>Tribunal members will be experts on the issues involved in your appeal. </p> 
  <p>All tribunals have a legally qualified member to help apply the law to your
appeal. </p> 
  <p><strong> </strong></p> 
  <p>You are able to choose how you want your appeal to be looked at, and can
request either an oral or paper hearing. </p> 
  <p>With an <strong>oral
hearing</strong>: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>You can
 attend the tribunal hearing </li> 
    <li>You may be
 asked questions </li> 
    <li>You can
 ask questions </li> 
    <li>You can
 take someone with you to represent you </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Tribunal Service may pay some of your expenses for going to the
hearing. </p> 
  <p>With a <strong>paper
hearing</strong>: </p> 
  <ul type="disc"> 
    <li>You do not
 need to attend the tribunal hearing </li> 
    <li>You must provide
 any information you think will help your case when sending your appeal for
 to the Tribunal Service </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Tribunal Service will write to you when they have made their decision. </p> 
  <h3>Making another appeal </h3> 
  <p>If you disagree with a decision made at your first appeal (at a first tier
tribunal) you can then appeal to another tribunal (an upper tribunal). These
appeals can only be made if a first tier tribunal has made an error of law. </p>
