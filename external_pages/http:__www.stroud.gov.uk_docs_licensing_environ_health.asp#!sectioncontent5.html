<p> We share our planet with a wide range of creatures. It is our responsibility to treat all animals humanely. This charter reflects the concerns of people in our District who care about animal welfare and support the view that all animals have a right to life free from cruel treatment and unnecessary suffering.

Dogs may be returned to the owners providing they have identification or they may be taken to an animal shelter. Not many dog owners know that it is a legal requirement to ensure their dog wears a collar and tag at all times when in a public place and that offending owners can risk prosecution with a fine of up to Â£5,000. </p>

            <p>When a lost or stray dog is picked up by the Dog Warden, all reasonable steps will be taken to contact the dog owner. If we cannot identify the owner, we will keep the dog for a period of 7 days.</p>

			<p> Should your dog be seized as a stray and taken to either our holding kennels or to our out of hours operators, the following charges will be made and are payable to Stroud District Council within 7 days of reunification with your dog (Please note there is no waiver for those in receipt of benefits, the full fee must be paid):<br />

<!--<h4>Barking dogs</h4>
			<p>Barking comes naturally to dogs, but the constant barking or whining of a dog can be disturbing or annoying for neighbours. Often the problem occurs when the dog's owner is out of the house. In law, a barking dog can be a noise nuisance and the Council can investigate the problem and taken legal action to prevent the nuisance if necessary.              </p>
			<p>There are a number of simple things that can be done to solve or prevent barking dog problems and the the following advice is for the benefit of dog owners. </p>
			<h4>Why dogs bark  </h4>

                There are many reasons why your dog may bark:
			<ul>
			  <li>loneliness </li>
			  <li> boredom </li>
			<li> frustration </li>
			<li>attention seeking </li>
			<li>defending his territory </li>
			<li>medical problems			</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Dogs are not solitary animals. They need the security of a family group. Pet dogs regard their owners as a substitute family and can soon become distressed when left alone. </p>
			<h4>The importance of training </h4>
			<p>Training is important so that your dog does not bark at just anything that moves. A well-trained dog should be able to tell between people allowed into the house and people who are intruders. Good training combined with affection and companionship should mean that your dog will not develop bad habits. Start young and start as you mean to go on. </p>
			<h4>Some simple things to try </h4>
			<p>Some dogs just don't want you to go out. Get your dog used to the idea that you are away for different periods of time at different times of the day. That way he might not be so concerned each time you leave. And don't make a fuss of your dog when you leave him. </p>
			<p>Try putting your dog on his own in another room - at first for a few minutes, then gradually build up the time you leave your dog alone. Do not return to your dog until he is quiet for a period. When you return, praise him/her. Some dogs will bark because they want to join in what's going on outside. If this is the problem, try leaving your dog so that he cannot see outside. Some dogs will settle only if they can hear a human voice. Leaving a radio on at low volume might help. But make sure the radio is not too loud. You don't want to have complaints about that! </p>
			<p>Try not to leave your dog for long periods. If you have to, see if there is someone who can look in during that time. Maybe that person could take your dog for a walk or let him out into the garden, if you have one. </p>
			<p>If you have to leave your dog for long periods: </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>feed and exercise him before you go out and leave him some fresh water; </li>
			  <li>make sure his bed or basket is comfortable and leave him his favourite toys; </li>
			<li>check that the room is not hot or too cold and that there is adequate ventilation; </li>
			<li>and if you aren't coming back until after dark, leave a light on. </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Some other suggestions </h4>
			<p>If you do keep your dog outside, think carefully about where you put his kennel and where he can run. Try not to put it near your neighbour's fence of where your dog will be tempted to bark. Don't blame the dog and think that you will solve everything by replacing him with another. It probably will not, unless you change your lifestyle at the same time. Getting a second dog for company might help. But think about this carefully. Do you have the space and can you afford a second dog? Another dog could result in more, not less, problems. </p>

             <h4>But nothing I do works </h4>
			<p>Old dogs can be taught new tricks. Ask your local Council's dog warden to suggest other things. You should also go to your vet. Sometimes a dog will bark because he is ill - anxiety is often the cause of barking. You can ask your vet to refer your dog to an animal behaviourist who is an expert and can suggest ways to improve your dog's behaviour. <br />

<h2>Food Safety and Hygiene </h2>
<br/><p> All food businesses that prepare, produce, cook or sell food are required to register with the council by law and they must comply with strict hygiene standards. If businesses do not meet these standards we will take action to secure the necessary improvements. All food authorities are required to set out their arrangements for enforcing food safety requirements in an annual food service plan. A copy of our plan can be found in the key documents below. </p>

                          <p>The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, which is is run by local authorities in partnership with the FSA, helps make it easier for consumers to choose places with good hygiene when eating out or shopping for food. The rating tells them about the hygiene standards in restaurants, pubs, cafÃ©s, takeaways, hotels and other places they eat out, as well as in supermarkets and other food shops. </p>
<p><a href="http://ratings.food.gov.uk/"><img src="/img/food.jpg" alt="Food Safety" /></a>

</p>
                          <p>In Gloucestershire, all 6 local authorities are implementing the scheme and as each food business is inspected by a local authority food safety officer, the business is given a rating. At the top of the rating scale is â5' â this means the hygiene standards are very good. At the bottom of the scale is â0' â this means urgent improvement is required. </p>
                          <p>Food hygiene ratings for businesses can be found by looking for the bright green and black window sticker or by searching on: <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/ratings">food.gov.uk/ratings</a>, where the food hygiene ratings for included premises are displayed. Examples of a 5 out of 5 sticker can be seen below. </p>
                          <p>The scheme applies to all businesses that sell food directly to consumers. Manufacturers and wholesalers are, therefore, excluded. Some very low risk businesses and those operating from a private, domestic premises are described as "exempt" on the web-site. </p>

						<div class="reveal-text-box">

                       <p>Before starting a new food business or taking over an existing one there are a few areas that you will need to consider. You may wish to contact us for advice or to discuss your plans. We can offer advice regarding design, layout, structural issues and general food hygiene to ensure the food you sell is safe. We can also advise you about potential problems such as odour nuisance and the need for control measures. </p>
						<p>You will need to check that you have all planning and building regulations approvals for the premises to be used as a food business and will therefore need to contact the Council's planning and building control services. If the business is classed as a place of entertainment or you sell food and drink to the public which is to be consumed on the premises you will need to provide public toilets. </p>
						<p>You will need to put in place a documented food safety management system. The Food Standards Agency has developed a simple system called Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) for caterers and retailers. SFBB is not suitable for all businesses. Complex or high risk processes such as food manufacturing or butchers shops will need more detailed plans based on HACCP principles. You will also need to arrange food hygiene training for yourself, your manager and your staff. See link to training courses offered by the Council. </p>
						<p>Any business that serves alcohol; provides regulated entertainment or operate s after 11.00pm will need to be licensed and you should contact the Licensing team for further information. </p>
						<p>The booklet Starting Up Your First Steps to running a catering business  can be downloaded below or from the Food Standards Agency website or you can contact us for a copy. </p>

						<p>28 days before you start trading you will need to register your premises with the Council. Registration is free and further details and the form can be found in the Food Premises Registration section. </p>
			</div>

<h3 class="closed" id="foodreg">Food Premises Registration</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">

<h4>Do I need to register my business? </h4>
<p>All food business operators (including operators of market stalls, delivery vehicles and other moveable structures) are required by law to register their food premises with the local authority. Registration allows food safety officers to keep an up-to-date list of all food premises in their area so we can visit them when we need to. The frequency of the visits will depend on the type of business. </p>
<p>If you run a food business in the Stroud District you must tell us about any premises you use for storing, selling, distributing or preparing food. Food premises includes restaurants, hotels, cafÃ©s, shops, supermarkets, staff canteens, kitchens in offices, warehouses, guest houses, delivery vehicles, buffet cars on trains, market and other stalls, hot dog and ice cream vans, etc. </p>
<p>If you use vehicles for your food business in connection with permanent premises such as a shop, or warehouse, you only need to tell the local authority how many vehicles you have. You do not need to register each vehicle separately. If you have one or more vehicles but no permanent premises, you must tell the authority where they are normally kept. </p>
<p>Anyone starting a new food business must register with the local authority at least 28 days before trading. </p>
<p>Sites will exist on which there are two or more food business establishments under the control of the same food business operator. For example, in the case of a shopping centre in which there are two or more food business establishments under the control of the same business operator, such operators must ensure that each establishment under their control is registered separately. Food business operators should therefore complete a registration form for each separate establishment. </p>
<p>Sites will also exist on which there are two or more food business establishments under the control of different food business operators. For example, a supermarket may have a coffee shop on site under the control of a different food business operator such as a coffee shop chain. In such cases the coffee shop will not be covered by the supermarket registration and must be registered in its own right by its operator. Coffee shops, snack bars etc. operated by the supermarket itself would be covered as part of the supermarket's registration. </p>
<h4>How do I register?</h4>
<p>By filling in the form below. Registration cannot be refused and there is no charge. The registration form must be sent to the Environmental Health Service at the address below. If the form is sent to the wrong address, your application will not take effect until it is received at the proper place. If you use premises in more than one local authority area, you must register with each authority separately. </p>
<p>You must tick all the boxes which apply to your business, answer all the questions and give all the information requested. Seasonal businesses operating for a certain period each year should give the dates between which they will be open in answer to question 12. If you have any questions please contact the Food Safety Team on 01453 754473 and we will help you. It is an offence to give information which you know to be false. </p>
<h4>What happens to the information given on the form?</h4>
<p>We will enter the details on our Register. A register of addresses and the type of business carried on at these will be open to inspection by the general public. Records of the other information provided will not be publicly available and will not be disclosed outside of Stroud District Council, Local Government Departments and Government Agencies. The details will by used for the purpose of registration, enforcement and the protection of public funds. </p>
<h4>What if my business changes? </h4>
<p>Once you have registered you only need to notify us of a change of Food Business Operator, if the nature of the business changes, or if there is a change of address at which moveable premises are kept. The new Food Business operator will have to complete a new registration form. </p>

						<div class="reveal-text-box">
						  <p> The Council's Food Safety Officers are responsible for inspecting around 1200 food business in the District, everything from food factories to restaurants and burger vans. It is estimated that around five million people suffer from food poisoning in England and Wales each year, so it is important that regular checks are made. </p>
						  <p>Officers are able to enter and inspect food premises at all reasonable hours. They do not have to make an appointment and will usually visit a premises without giving any notice. </p>
						  <p>Some food premises are inspected at least every 6 months, while others are only inspected once every 5 years. How often the premises are inspected will depend on the level of risk associated with the business. The risk depends upon the type of food business, the nature of the food, the degree of handling, the number and type of customers served, the design and structure of the premises and confidence in management. </p>
						  <p>Those premises posing a higher risk to the consumer will be inspected more regularly than those premises with a low risk. It is important to note that these are minimum inspection frequencies and local authorities may carry out more frequent inspections if they consider it to be necessary. </p>
						  <h4>The Inspection Process </h4>
						  <p>During an inspection, Officers will want to reassure themselves that potential food safety risks have been identified by the business, and that there are adequate controls in place to prevent any problems. They will also look at the training of managers and food handlers to ensure that it is suitable, and they will check that the condition of the premises and equipment is satisfactory.</p>
                          <p>The officer will then carry out a detailed inspection, which may include the following: </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Looking at the cleanliness and structural condition of the premises. </li>
                            <li>Ensuring compliance with regulations. </li>
                            <li>Examining, various records in relation to the adequacy of training of staff, temperature monitoring of frozen, chilled, cooked and re-heated foodstuffs, cleaning schedules and pest control records </li>
                            <li>Discussing food safety practices and procedures. </li>
                            <li>Taking samples for microbiological examination </li>
                          </ul>
                          <h4>Closing Meeting </h4>
                          At the end of the inspection the officer will discuss the findings with the proprietor or other person in charge. In particular they will:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Discuss and explain any significant findings. </li>
                            <li>Make a clear distinction between contraventions and recommendations of good practice. </li>
                            <li>Explain what enforcement action, if any, is proposed. </li>
                            <li>Discuss solutions to problems and time scales for action. </li>
                          </ul>
                          <h4>Enforcement Options </h4>
                          <p>Where practices or conditions are not satisfactory, every attempt will be made to resolve the situation by informal means, but where poor conditions persist, or where there is a risk to public health it may be necessary to resort to formal action. This could involve either the service of a legal notice, prosecution, or in extreme cases closure of the business. After the inspection, the officer will write to the proprietor of the food business, confirming the visit and providing details of any areas requiring attention. </p>
                          <p>The letter will clearly state the statutory requirements that are not being complied with and what has to be done to comply with the law. Reasonable time will be given to comply, except where there is an immediate risk to public health, when other enforcement action may be taken. In addition advice on good practice will be provided. </p>
                          <p>Some premises producing products of animal origin may require approval under EC Regulation 853/2004 before the business can operate. Contact us for more specific information. </p>

						<div class="reveal-text-box">

                       <h4> Food Complaints </h4>
                       <p>UK food businesses are regularly inspected by Food Safety Officers to ensure compliance with the law but occasionally things do go wrong. The food might have something in it, which shouldn't be there, or it might smell or taste strange . You are entitled to know that the matter has been thoroughly investigated. </p>
                       <p>You can complain directly to the supplier or manufacturer of the food but once you have given them the food and packaging it will be very difficult for us to investigate. </p>
                       <p>If you bring the complaint to our attention we will deal with it as promptly as possible. We will need any food remains or the foreign object, as much of the packaging as possible and the receipt. Once you hand over the complaint it becomes our property and it may be subject to analysis, which might destroy the product. This may make it difficult for you to take private, civil action at a later date. </p>
                       <p>When we receive a food complaint we take the matter very seriously. However, investigations do not necessarily result in legal proceedings. It is not always possible to obtain sufficient evidence to show that the food business was at fault or the business may be able to claim that it had exercised "due diligence" and taken reasonable precautions to stop the food being unsatisfactory. UK food law accepts that, from time to time, in spite of the best efforts of the company, things do occasionally slip through the net. </p>
                       <p>We investigate complaints by contacting the supplier or manufacturer and, if it is out of our area, we might contact the Local Authority where the food is made. If the food business can demonstrate that they have taken reasonable precautions to stop the fault from occurring then the matter will be dealt with informally. If, however, there appears to be a serious breakdown in the control systems then legal action may be taken. A notice may be served requiring improvements to be made or the offender may be prosecuted. If it is a first offence then the Council may offer a âformal caution' rather than prosecute but if the company offends again both offences could be taken into consideration by the Courts. </p>
                       <p>If we decide to prosecute we would need a signed statement from you and you might be asked to appear in court as a witness. If you are not happy about this it would be helpful if you could let us know at an early stage. </p>

						<h2>Pollution</h2>

<h3 class="closed" id="contaminated">Contaminated Land</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">
  <p>In common with many other countries, the UK has a legacy of land contamination arising from industrial development and related operational practices. Much land contamination has been present since the eighteenth century. </p>
  <p>Contaminated land can cause harm to human health, water supplies, natural habitats and human property. Concern about contaminated land can affect property prices and obstruct development. </p>
  <p>Not all contamination poses problems and some may only be of concern if the land is used for a particular purpose. It may only be necessary to deal with some contamination when a piece of land is used for a new purpose, for example, when an old industrial site is redeveloped for housing. </p>
  <p>It is one of the Council's duties, under the Environmental Protection Act, Part IIA, to identify contaminated land in the district and to compile a register of contaminated sites. The 'Strategy for the Identification of Contaminated Land; which was published in 2001, sets out how potentially contaminated land will be inspected and investigated. A database of information on the current and historical uses and characteristics for potentially contaminated sites is under development. The Council has powers to enforce remediation of sites that are determined as contaminated land. </p>
  <p>Stroud district has a long heritage of industrial activity which has the likelihood of land contamination associated with it. The contamination on those former industrial sites that have been redeveloped will already have been remediated as a result of conditions imposed during the planning process. </p>

<h3 class="closed" id="contreg">Contaminated Land Public Register</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">
<p>The Environmental Protection Act 1990 Part IIa requires Stroud District Council to maintain a public register. A register entry will be created when one of the following happens:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the land is designated a special site </li>
   <li>a remediation declaration is published </li>
   <li>a remediation statement is published, or </li>
   <li>a remediation notice is served. </li>
</ul>
 <p>This means the Council does not have to put the notification that the land is contaminated land on the register until one of these actions has been undertaken. At this point much of the information that was contained in the original notification will be included in the register entry.</p>

 <p>The regulations specify the information to be included in the register. Therefore the register will include:</p>


 <ul>
   <li>remediation notices </li>
   <li>site information and details of site reports obtained by the authority relating to remediation notices </li>
   <li>designation of sites as 'special sites' </li>
   <li>site specific guidance issued by the Environment Agency </li>
   <li>remediation declarations, remediation statements and notifications of claimed remediation </li>
   <li>any appeals lodged against remediation and charging notices </li>
   <li>convictions for non compliance with notices </li>
   <li>statement regarding the existence of confidential information </li>
 </ul>

 <p>The absence of an entry on the register does not guarantee that</p>
 <ul>
 <li>the land is free from contamination, as it may not have been fully assessed </li>
 <li>the contamination present does not pose significant risk</li>
 <li>contamination present is not polluting controlled waters</li>

 </ul>

<h3 class="closed" id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">
<h4>Are there any risks to the environment?</h4>
<p>Contaminated sites could lead to the pollution of rivers and watercourses, odour, poor soil quality (which can inhibit plant growth) and discolouration of buildings. There may also be economic factors such as a drop in land value.
</p>
<h4>How does contaminated land occur?</h4>
<p>Contaminated land occurs through polluting industries, such as engineering works, smelters, gas works, power stations, petroleum storage and distribution sites, chemical manufacturers, the rubber industry, textiles, printing works, waste incineration and of particular importance to Stroud District, the manufacture and disposal of asbestos cement products.

</p>
<h4>How will I know if my new home is on a contaminated site?</h4>
<p>Your solicitor will conduct an environmental search against our records, but the chances of finding anything to worry about are remote.</p>
<h4>What are the potential risks to human health?</h4>
<p>Possible risks from exposure to contaminants may be caused by eating vegetables that have grown in contaminated soil, breathing in dust, drinking contaminated water, or through skin contact with contaminated soil.
</p>
<h4>What can I do if I know of a site that is likely to be contaminated?</h4>
<p>You can contact the Contaminated Land Officer, Katie Evans, on 01453 754489 who will investigate the site and assess whether there is contamination that may be harmful to health or to controlled waters, then take appropriate action to deal with the situation.</p>
<h4>What does contaminated land mean?</h4>
<p>Land is classed as contaminated if there are substances present in it, on it, or under it that may pose a threat to human health.

</p>
<h4>Who pays for the clean up of contaminated land?</h4>
<p>In cases where the site is being redeveloped, the developer pays. In other cases, we try to trace the original polluter, who is liable for the clean up costs under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
</p>
<h4>Why is contaminated land cleaned up?</h4>
<p>Contaminated land is cleaned up to make it safe for it's existing use, and for any redevelopment proposed on the site.

<h3 class="closed" id="emptyprop">Empty Properties</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">
<p><a href="/info/env_health/wanted_poster.pdf"><img src="/img/wanted.jpg" alt="Your properties wanted" width="150" height="229" border="0" class="artistic_right"/></a>An empty property is a wasted resource both for the owner of the property and those in need of housing. </p>

<p>Properties which are left vacant for extend periods of time can cause problems for the local environment, the surrounding community and reduce the value of neighbouring homes. </p>
<h4>What we can do to help </h4>
<p>The Council offers FREE help and advice to owners of empty properties and will assist owners in bringing the property back into use. For an informal chat please call our Empty Homes Officer on 01453 754449. </p>
<h4>Tax Relief</h4>
<p>Owners of empty homes are entitled to VAT relief on certain renovation costs associated with bringing a property back into use. If a property has been empty for 2 years or more the standard rate of VAT is reduced down to 5% on renovations. Please contact the Empty Homes Officer if you require a letter to state how long the property has been unoccupied. There are also other exemptions with regard to VAT, such as properties which are listed. It is worth looking on the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/index.htm">HMRC website</a> to find out more. </p>
<h4>Report an Empty Property</h4>
<p>If you are concerned or aware of an empty property please contact us. An empty homes officer will investigate the property and make every effort to contact the owner with the aim of bringing the property back into use. </p>
<p>Report an <a href="../../machinery/reportit.asp?doit=reportit&amp;rid=84">empty property</a> or email us on <a href="mailto:empty.properties@stroud.gov.uk">empty.properties@stroud.gov.uk </a></p>
<h4>Enforcement Action</h4>
<p>There is a variety of legislation that can be used to address particular problems that are being caused by an empty property. Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) were introduced in the Housing Act 2004 and came into force in April 2006. If an owner refuses all voluntary options to bring the property back into use, EDMOs maybe considered. The EDMO allows Councils to take over the management of empty residential properties with a view to agreeing with owners a plan to bring the property back into occupation. EDMOs can be used where a property has been left empty for more than 6 months. A final EDMO allows a local authority to collect rent and other payment from the occupant of the property and use it to meet relevant expenses that the local authority has incurred. </p>
<p>Under the Law of Property Act 1925 the Council is given the power to Enforced the Sale of empty properties in order to release the money tied up in the value of the property to pay for works that the Council has undertaken. </p>
<p>Ultimately the Council has the power to use a Compulsory Purchase Order. </p>
<h4><strong>Gloucestershire Empty Property Framework 2008</strong></h4>

<div class="reveal-text-box">

	<h4>I'm looking for privately rented accommodation but am unable to find the rent in advance and / or the deposit which is required by most landlords. Can the Council help ?
    </h4>
<br/>
<p>   The Council may be able to help with either or both issues</p>
 <p> <strong>Deposit Bond </strong></p>
 <p>Depending on circumstances the Council can provide landlords with a bond in the form of a guarantee. This means that if the property or its contents are damaged the landlord can submit a claim to the Council at the end of the tenancy. If the Council does pay a valid claim they will reclaim the money from you. </p>
 <p>The bond does not cover normal wear and tear or rent arrears and has a maximum value of one months rent. Bonds are valid for 12 months from the start of the tenancy but are renewable subject to conditions. </p>
 <p><strong>Rent In Advance </strong></p>
 <p>In some circumstances the Council can pay Rent In Advance equivalent to one months Housing Benefit direct to the landlord at the beginning of the tenancy. </p>
 <p>This will then be recovered from your Benefit in instalments over a 12 month period. </p>
 <p>You are expected to make up the subsequent short fall in benefit directly to your landlord. </p>
 <p><strong>Requirements </strong></p>
 <p>To be able to apply for help under the Deposit Bond and Rent in Advance schemes you have to be over 25 if you are single, over 18 if you are a couple or over 18 with at least one dependant child. </p>

<h3 class="closed" id="dfg">Disabled Facilities Grants</h3>
<div class="reveal-text-box">
 <p>
  If you are disabled this type of grant is aimed at making your home more suitable for you to live in and to help you manage more independently in your home. Please read the following FAQ's before applying.</p>
 <h4>Can I apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant?  </h4>
 <p> You can apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant if: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>You are registered, or registerable as a disabled person and either own your own home (including a mobile home or houseboat) or are a private tenant ; or </li>
 <li>You have a disabled person living with you in your home; or </li>
 <li>You are a landlord and have a tenant who is disabled. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Note: If you are unsure if you or someone living with you is registerable as disabled, you can obtain advice from the Social Services Department by telephoning 01452 426868. </p>
 <h4> How is the means test calculated for the Disabled Facilities Grant? </h4>
 <p> The information below gives you an idea of the principles which are involved, BUT it will not show you how to calculate the grant you might receive. </p>
 <p>The means test is calculated by following these four steps: </p>
 <p>1) Your average weekly income is calculated - By looking at your income over the past twelve months including interest on savings of more than Â£6,000, and deducting: Income Tax, National Insurance, Pension Scheme Payments and eligible child-care costs.</p>
 <p>2) Personal allowances are subtracted from your income - This is similar to the principle of Housing Benefit where fixed allowances are made for your personal circumstances including:<br />
     -
         Number of dependant children <br />
         -
         Special Disabilities<br />
         -
         Retired persons<br />
         -
         Single parents etc </p>
 <p>3) The amount which is left is used to estimate the maximum that the government says you can borrow - The proportion of your income in excess of your personal allowances is used to calculate the maximum loan you could, in theory borrow to finance the works. You would be expected to obtain this loan through the private sector. </p>
 <p>4) Amount of grant available - The loan you are considered to be able to afford is then deducted from the cost of the eligible works and what is left will be the amount of grant you are entitled to, subject to a maximum grant limit of Â£25,000. </p>
 <p>If you would like more detailed information please ask us to give you an estimate of your likely contribution under the means test. This will be based on your particular case, but it is important to remember that the final figure cannot be decided until you make a full application. Alternatively you can download a preliminary owner/occupiers means test form below and return it to us. <br />

 <h4> How much assistance can I get with a Disabled Facilities Grant? </h4>
 <p> The Disabled Facilities grant is meant to make up the difference between the total cost of the work which is needed and the money you might be able to borrow on the strength of your income up to a maximum grant limit of Â£25,000. </p>
 <h4> How do I apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant? </h4>
 <p> If you think you may qualify for a grant, please contact the Occupational Therapists at Social Services on 01452 426868 for an assessment of your needs. </p>
   <p>If you would like a preliminary assessment under the means test to find out if you are likely to qualify you can contact us by telephone 01453 754459 or write to us at: </p>
