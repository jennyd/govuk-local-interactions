<div id="Summary">
<p>There are an estimated 8.5 million dogs in the UK. Nearly one in every four households is thought to keep one or more dogs. They provide friendship, companionship and security for many. But a wrongly looked after dog can cause noise, fouling and intimidation.</p><p>Heres our quick guide to dogs and the law.</p>
</div>
<h2>Dog fouling</h2><p>South Derbyshires Dog Control Order makes it illegal for an owner not to pick up after their dog in all public open land in South Derbyshire. Our Safer Neighbourhood Wardens have a target of carrying out at least 500 dog fouling patrols in our parks and streets each year. They are also instructed to investigate all complaints about dog fouling and to act on any intelligence about possible offenders.</p><p>The local laws about dog fouling, including the rules about any areas from which dogs are banned or where they must be kept on leads are contained in our <a href="/environment/animal_welfare/dog_control_orders/default.asp" >Dog Control Orders</a></p><p>Academic research has shown that a small percentage (about three per cent) of dog walkers refuse to pick up after their dog. If we catch these people in the act then they will be punished.</p><p>However, in surveys 90 per cent of dog walkers say they always pick up. Yet in observational studies only 63 per cent always did so. If the figures are true then 27 per cent of dog owners who think they always pick up, sometimes dont.</p><p>We think that working with this group of dog owners to make sure that they do always pick up will make a big difference. Thats why we promote the <a href="/environment/animal_welfare/green_dog_walkers/default.asp" >Green Dog Walking pledge</a>.</p><p>We often get asked why we don't use DNA analysis to catch offenders. Our councillors asked us to look into the viability of DNA sampling to help increase enforcement and we produced a short report for them in October 2014 which is available in the related documents section. We concluded that it won't work at the moment because of three factors - the science, the law and the cost</p><h2>Stray dogs</h2><p>If a dog is found to be straying in a public place the council has a duty to seize the dog and either return it to its owner (if known) or to kennel it for no less than seven days. If a stray dog is on private land it can only be seized by the council with the permission of the owner or occupier of the land. There is a specific legal process for seizing and rehoming stray dogs which is laid out in Part VIII of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p><p>If an owner allows a dog to trespass onto private land where he / she has no right to allow it to be then various rules apply:</p><ul><li>if the dog enters of its own accord, but does no more, then there is no offence.</li><li>if the dog causes damage, then the same rules apply as stated below (damage by dogs)</li><li>if the dog is aggressive, then the same rules apply as for dangerous dogs (see below)</li><li>specific rules apply if the dog damages livestock or game.</li></ul><p>Stray dogs can be reported to the council's stray dog contractor tel:&nbsp;01283 585510 or 0792 8014873 or to the council's Contact Centre, tel: 01283 595795.</p><p>If the dog is micro chipped or has a collar we will usually return it straight to the owner with no charge. Unidentifiable dogs or repeat strays are taken to the kennels and we make a charge for them to be returned to their owner.</p><h2>Dangerous dogs</h2><p>The Dangerous Dogs Act creates four primary controls on dogs:</p><ul><li>it prohibits the possession of named breeds, other than under strict conditions</li><li>it enables the government to impose further restrictions on other dogs if and when it sees fit</li><li>it creates an offence if someone allows a dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place</li><li>it creates an offence of allowing a dog to enter a place (other than a public place) and to either injure a person, or have reasonable grounds to have apprehension that it will injure a person.</li></ul><p>The police control the enforcement of dangerous dog law. They have specialist officers with extensive expertise and experience in relation to dangerous dogs. Any incidents should be reported to the 101 line with a specific request to speak to the Dog Control Unit because often the call handlers will mistakenly think that all dog complaints need to go through the local council. See our <a href="/environment/animal_welfare/dangerous_dogs_act/default.asp" >dangerous dogs</a> page for more information.</p><h2>Dog noise</h2><p>Noisy dogs can cause a statutory nuisance if they cause a material interference with the use or enjoyment of someone elses property. Whether the noise of a barking dog is deemed to be a nuisance depends on how often the dog barks, for how long and how significant the effect of the barking is on the people being affected.</p><p>There are no hard and fast rules about times of day or decibel levels (a measure of loudness). Complaints about noise can be made to the local Environmental Health Department of the council and whether a dog is causing a nuisance is usually dependent on the opinion of the investigating officer who will have plenty of experience to help him or her reach a decision.</p><p>More information about noise nuisances can be found on our <a href="/environment/pollution/making_a_noise_complaint/default.asp" >noise webpage</a></p><h2>Damage by dogs</h2><p>If a dog causes damage then the keeper may have committed a civil offence under the Animals Act 1971. The rules are complicated and generally damage to humans or inanimate objects is included, but not injury to other animals. If you are concerned about the damage inflicted by a dog then speak to a solicitor.</p><h2>Service targets and historical performance stats</h2><p>It is our target to respond to all dog fouling complaints within three days. On average we take two days.</p><p>We also have a target of making sure that our Safer Neighbourhood wardens carry out at least 500 proactive dog enforcement patrols a year. This was a new target for 2014/15.</p><p>We survey most of our clients to find out if we solved or improved complaints they made about problems with dogs. We have a target of achieving 75 per cent who tell us that we made a difference. Our performance has varied between 73 to 84 per cent in recent years.</p><p>We give our stray dog contractors a target of getting to every reported stray dog within four hours.</p><h2>Contact details</h2><p>Safer Neighbourhood Wardens
