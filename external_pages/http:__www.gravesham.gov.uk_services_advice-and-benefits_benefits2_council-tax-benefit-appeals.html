<!-- MyS: body -->
          <p><strong>If you are getting Housing Benefit, this section will tell you what you can do if you think a decision is wrong.</strong></p><p>The decision could be about:</p><ul><li>The amount of benefit payable</li><li>The rent eligible for benefit</li><li>The calculation of your income</li><li>The calculation and recovery of an overpayment</li></ul><p>You must contact us straight away because if you want us to look at the decision again or if you want to appeal against it, you must do it in writing within one month of the date of the decision letter, not the date you contact the office.</p><p>If you are still not happy after our reply, you can appeal or request a revision of our decision. You have one month from the date of the decision tom write and ask us to look at it again.</p><p>Some decisions, mainly administrative decisions, do not carry a right of appeal. We will tell you if what you are disputing does not carry the right of appeal.</p><p><strong>Do you want more information?</strong>If yes, you must request this in writing within one calendar month of our decision letter.</p><p>You can ask us:</p><ol><li><a href="#One">To explain the decision</a></li><li><a href="#Two">For a written explanation of your benefit award</a></li><li><a href="#Three">Or you can appeal against the decision in writing</a></li></ol><p><a id="One" name="One"></a><strong><a id="One" name="One"></a><a id="One" name="One"><strong>1.</strong></a> To explain the decision</strong></p><p>You must do this in writing within <strong>one calendar month</strong> of the date of our decision letter. If you ask for a written statement of reasons for our decision, and then decide to ask us to look at the decision again, or to appeal or ask us to look at the decision again, the one month time limit will extended by the time we take to prepare the statement.</p><p><a id="Two" name="Two"></a><strong><a id="Two" name="Two"></a><a id="Two" name="Two"><strong>2.</strong></a> For a written explanation of your benefit award</strong></p><p>You must do this within one month of our decision letter. If your request is later than one month you must tell us in writing of the reason for the delay.</p><p><strong>If the decision can be changed</strong></p><p>We will send you a letter explaining what the new decision is. If your request is within one month of our decision letter, the new decision will apply from the date of the decision. If we receive your letter later than one month after our decision letter, the new decision will normally apply from the date we receive the request.</p><p>If you do not agree with the new decision you can still ask for it to be looked at again.</p><p><strong>If the decision cannot be changed</strong></p><p>We will send you a letter confirming the original decision. The letter will tell you if you can appeal. If you can and want to appeal, you must start this process within one month from the date of the letter confirming our decision.</p><p><a id="Three" name="Three"></a><strong><a id="Three" name="Three"><strong>3.</strong></a> Or you can appeal against the decision in writing</strong></p><ol><li>Do you have the right to appeal against the decision?</li><li>Believe the decision is wrong?</li><li>Want to appeal against the decision?</li></ol><p><strong>If you answer yes to all three questions you need to either:-</strong></p><ul><li>Write an appeal letter which includes details of your objections and the reasons for your appeal.&nbsp; You should provide any documentary evidence that you feel will support your case;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>or</p><ul><li>Complete an appeal form which can be collected from our offices in Windmill Street, or sent to you in the post.</li></ul><p>You will need to:</p><ul><li>complete all the boxes on the form. You can ask for help from an advice centre or a solicitor or a person of your choice.</li><li>Write down all the reasons for your appeal. This is important because the tribunal does not look at anything you do not mention.</li><li>Make sure you sign the form</li><li>Return&nbsp;the form back to the Council offices within one calendar month of the date of&nbsp;our decision letter</li></ul><p>Your appeal should be sent or hand delivered to our offices:-</p><p>Housing Benefits, Gravesham Borough Council, Civic Centre, Windmill Street, Gravesend, Kent.&nbsp; DA12 1AU</p><p>Your appeal must be received within one month of the date of our refusal letter.</p><p>Once your appeal is received by our Appeals Officer your case will be reviewed.</p><p><strong>What happens after I've made an appeal?</strong>After you have made an appeal we will look at the decision we have made. If we agree that the original decision is wrong and the new decision is to your advantage we will send you a new decision and your appeal will stop. If you do not agree with the new decision you can appeal against it.</p><p>If we agree that the original decision is wrong but the new decision is not to your advantage we will send you a new decision. You have another month to comment on the new decision, after which time we will send your appeal to the Appeals Service.</p><p>If we do not change our decision, we will send your appeal and an explanation of the law and facts used to make the decision to the Appeals Service. We will also include any other relevant papers. A copy of the appeal papers will be sent to you and your representative if you have one. You will then be contacted by the Appeals Service.</p><p>Read the appeal papers very carefully. If you do not understand something, ask us, an advice centre or solicitor to explain.</p><p>You will also receive a form called TAS1HBR. You must complete this form and send it to the appeals service within <strong>14 days</strong> of the date the form was sent to you. <strong>If you do not your appeal will stop</strong>.</p><p><strong>You can withdraw your appeal at any time.</strong>The Appeals Service will decide your appeal at a tribunal hearing. The tribunal is made up of people who are not from the local authority.</p><p><strong>If you cannot appeal against the decision you can still ask us to look at it again.</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: If the Appeals Tribunal finds that you have been receiving too much money your benefit will be reduced</strong>.</p><p><strong>What the Appeals Tribunal looks at</strong>It can only look at the evidence, law and circumstances at the time we made the decision you are appealing against. It cannot look at changes that happened after we made the decision.</p><p><strong>If a change of circumstances might affect your benefit or mean that you could claim again, you should report it straight away.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for the appeal hearing</strong>.</p><p><strong>Late appeals</strong>The Appeals Service may not be able to accept your appeal if it is received more than one calendar month after the date on your decision letter.</p><p><strong>Oral hearing</strong></p><ul><li>This is an appeal hearing which you can go to</li><li>The tribunal may ask you questions</li><li>You can ask questions</li><li>You can take someone to represent you</li><li>One of our representatives may be at the hearing. They may ask you questions or call witnesses</li><li>If you choose an oral hearing but find you cannot go, you must let the appeals service know straight away. You must have a good reason why you cannot go, such as illness. You may be able to arrange another date. If you do not let the appeals service know you cannot go to the hearing, the tribunal may hear your appeal without you.</li><li>Oral hearings are usually open to the public, but anyone who goes to the hearing will usually be involved in the appeal. You can ask to have your appeal heard in private.</li><li>If you live abroad and want an oral hearing, let the Appeals Service know you want to go to the hearing or want someone to represent you. The Appeals Service can arrange for your appeal hearing to be:<br /><ul><li>as near as possible to the place you arrive in Great Britain</li><li>as near as possible to your representative, if you have one</li><li>delayed until you are in Great Britain.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Expenses</strong>The Appeals Service may pay for some of your expenses for going to the tribunal, for example travel costs. If you want more information about expenses, contact the Appeals Service handling your appeal.</p><p>If you live abroad you will have to pay your own fares to and from Great Britain. You may be able to get expenses while you are in Great Britain and the appeals hearing is going on.</p><p><strong>Paper hearing</strong></p><ul><li>This is an appeal hearing that you do not have to go to.</li><li>If you go to an oral hearing, you will be able to deal with any questions or issues that arise.</li></ul><p>You should use the form we will send to you with the appeal papers to add any more information, which you think will help your case.</p><p>Do not delay in sending information, as you will not be told of the date of a paper hearing.</p><p>The appeal will be heard and the Appeals Service will send you the decision.</p><p>If the tribunal think you need to go to an oral hearing, they can refuse your request for a paper hearing.</p><p><strong>If you choose a paper hearing but change your mind, you can choose to have an oral hearing. Write to the Appeals Service straight away.</strong></p><p><strong>The result</strong>Whether you request an oral or paper hearing:</p><ul><li>You will be given a <strong>decision notice</strong> explaining the tribunal's decision as soon as possible after the appeal hearing. A copy will be sent to the office that made the original decision.</li><li>You can also ask for a <strong>statement of reasons.</strong> This gives an explanation of the tribunal's decision including the facts and the law used. You must ask for a <strong>statement of reasons</strong> within <strong>one month</strong> of the date you are given or sent the decision notice. You must have a copy of this statement if you appeal to the social security commissioners.</li><li>If you want a record of the appeal hearing, you can get a copy of the record of proceedings up to 6 months from the date of the hearing.</li><li>If your appeal is successful, we will usually put the decision right as soon as we receive our copy of the tribunal's decision. We may not put it right straight away if we appeal to the social security commissioners.</li></ul><p><strong>Organisations that can help</strong>Advice centres, like the Citizens Advice Bureau, can represent and help you understand the reasons for decisions about Housing and Council Tax Benefits. They can also help you fill in forms or to write a letter. They will sometimes go with you to the tribunal that hears your appeal.</p><p>The Citizens Advice Bureau is at:<br />Civic Centre, Windmill Street, Gravesend, Kent<br />Telephone: 01474 87 86 39&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to do if you disagree with the tribunal's decision</strong></p><p><strong>Appeals to the Social Security Commissioners</strong>If you do not agree with the appeal tribunal's decision you may be able to appeal to the Social Security Commissioners.</p><p>The commissioners are barristers, solicitors or advocates of not less than 10 year's standing and are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Lord Chancellor. They are independent of both the Department of Work and Pensions and the Local Authority.</p><p><strong>Who can appeal to the commissioners?</strong>Appeals can be made by:</p><ul><li>anyone who has already appealed to the Appeals Service</li><li>The local authority (in this case Gravesham Borough Council)</li><li>The Department of Work and Pensions</li></ul><p><strong>What you can appeal to the commissioners about?</strong>You can only appeal to the commissioners about a point of law. You cannot appeal to the commissioners about:</p><ul><li>questions of facts</li><li>a tribunal's findings or conclusions</li></ul><p><strong>How to appeal</strong>Your decision letter from the appeals service will tell you what to do if you are unhappy with the decision. Read this carefully. It tells you the time limits for your appeal.</p><ul><li>You cannot appeal unless you first get a <strong>statement of reasons</strong> for the tribunal's decision.</li><li>You should read the <strong>statement of reasons</strong> carefully. If you think the tribunal did not apply the law correctly, you can apply for leave to appeal to the Commissioners. You must do this within one month of the date the <strong>statement</strong> <strong>of reasons</strong> was sent to you.</li><li>If you appeal to the commissioners, you must send the statement of reasons with your application. If you fail to do this your application may not be looked at.</li><li>A legally qualified tribunal member will decide if your appeal can be sent to the commissioners or if a different tribunal should look at the appeal again.</li><li>You can ask an advice bureau, solicitor or other suitable person to help with your appeal.</li></ul><p><strong>Late applications</strong>Late applications for a <strong>statement of reasons</strong> or leave to appeal to the commissioners can only be accepted if there are special circumstances or special reasons that caused the delay. You will need to show why you were not able to make your request on time.</p><!-- MyS: DList -->
