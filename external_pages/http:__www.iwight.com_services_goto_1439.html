    <h2>About the Emergency Management Team</h2><img src="/azservices/images/1128-Picture1.GIF" style="float:right" alt="LRF and IRF Logos" /><h3>What is Emergency Management?</h3>
<p>Emergencies happen frequently on the Island &ndash; traffic incidents, fires, etc. &ndash; but the Emergency&nbsp;Management Team are not necessarily always involved. We step in to assist, when events happen that are beyond the capacity of the emergency services to deal with unaided and we co-ordinate the local authority response. We can help with things like specialist equipment, evacuation, housing and emergency feeding, extra manpower. We can&rsquo;t always provide the resource ourselves, but generally &lsquo;we know someone who can&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Emergency&nbsp;Management is a means of assessing the threats and risks to the Island and putting plans in place to respond to an incident and assist in the recovery as defined by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others" target="_blank">Civil Contingencies Act (2004)</a>&nbsp;(website).</p>
<p>The Act focuses on emergency preparedness but its requirements should be seen in the context of Integrated Emergency Management of which the following six activities are fundamental to an integrated approach:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anticipation. </li>
    <li>Assessment. </li>
    <li>Prevention.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Preparation. </li>
    <li>Response. </li>
    <li>Recovery management. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the work under statutory regimes in the field of Civil Protection duties that the Isle of Wight Council adhere to are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996 &nbsp; </li>
    <li>Radiation (Emergency Preparedness &amp; Public Information) Regulations 2001 &nbsp; </li>
    <li>The Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) </li>
</ul>
<p>Local Authorities have joined the emergency services in formal strategic liaison arrangements to ensure greater consistency and co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders at the local level. Further explanation of how we carry out these duties can be found in the Partnership Working section of this page below. </p>
<h3>What Emergency Management&nbsp;do </h3>
<p>Well, the response to any major incident will inevitably be multi-agency and could involve the Emergency Services, Public Services, Military, Voluntary Agencies, Industry, Local Authority &ndash; which of course includes us &ndash; and a host of other organisations within the public and private sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our role is to provide support to the emergency services, co-ordinate the resources required from the Local Authority and take the lead in recovery management in facilitating the rehabilitation of the community and restoration of the environment. </p>
<p>The success of the response will depend to a great degree on how we all work together at times of extreme pressure. We therefore need to form good relationships across the board and continually plan, train, exercise, consult and liaise/network across both the Island and mainland, to ensure the most appropriate, co-ordinated and effective response to any incident is provided.</p>
<p>The Emergency Management Team provides a Duty Officer 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, who is responsible for activating key Council staff - advising them of appropriate measures to take, assisting throughout the incident and into the recovery phase.</p>
<p>Whatever the incident, the role of the Council is always to provide support and care to the Island community and the environment, and to get things back to normality as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>What type of incidents Emergency Management are involved in</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Adverse Weather (heat/cold/snow etc.). </li>
    <li>Flooding. </li>
    <li>Suspect Packages/Explosive Devices. </li>
    <li>Disposal of dead whales/porpoises. </li>
    <li>Foot and Mouth outbreak. </li>
    <li>Chemical canisters washed ashore. </li>
    <li>Oil/Chemical/Diesel spills. </li>
    <li>Asbestos incidents. </li>
    <li>Fuel Supply Disruption. </li>
    <li>Evacuation of people from their homes. </li>
    <li>Landslip. </li>
    <li>Suspected SARS outbreak on the Island. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How we can help</h3>
<p>We can do this in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open our Emergency Control Room. </li>
    <li>Co-ordinate the Local Authority and Voluntary Sector response. </li>
    <li>Liaise with outside agencies i.e. Emergency Services, utilities, military etc. </li>
    <li>Provide support to the Emergency Services. </li>
    <li>Arrange for rest centres to be opened, equipped and staffed. </li>
    <li>Arrange for the provision of food and welfare support within the rest centre. </li>
    <li>Organise contact with a Translation Service if required. </li>
    <li>Organise extra communication links. </li>
    <li>Organise transport. </li>
    <li>Provide information to the public and set up help-lines, if required. </li>
    <li>Responding to the press and opening a Media Briefing Centre, if necessary. </li>
    <li>Organise the setting up of a Temporary Mortuary. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Emergency&nbsp;Management Team is a good information source and can offer a wide range of advice and guidance. We also have an extensive Resources Database containing information ranging from Air Transport to Weather. </p>
<h3>Partnership Working &ndash; Strengthening the Island&rsquo;s Resilience</h3>
<p>The Civil Contingencies Action 2004 (The Act) and associated guidance introduced the concept of Local Resilience Forums (LRF&rsquo;s). This is the principal mechanism for multi-agency cooperation under the Act and is based on each Police Force area. Therefore we, and other local responders, are members of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emergencies-responsibilities-of-responder-agencies-and-others" target="_blank">Hampshire and Isle of Wight Local Resilience Forum</a> (website).</p>
<p>The purpose of the LRF is to ensure effective delivery of duties under The Act that need to be developed in a multi-agency environment. In particular, the LRF process should deliver: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The compilation of agreed risk profiles for the area, through a Community Risk Register. </li>
    <li>A systematic, planned and co-ordinated approach to encourage Category 1 responders, according to their functions, to address all aspects of policy in relation to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    <li>Planning for emergencies </li>
                    <li>Planning for business continuity management&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    <li>Publishing information about risk assessment and plans&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
                    <li>Arrangements to warn and inform the public and </li>
                    <li>Other aspects of the civil protection duty, including promotion of business continuity management by local authorities, support and preparation by all of multi-agency plans and other documents, and the coordination of multi-agency exercises and training events. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Following creation of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Local Resilience Forum, the Island Resilience Forum (IRF) was formed as a subgroup to provide an Isle of Wight dimension to planning, concentrating on the risks and challenges faced by island communities.</p>
<p>The IRF consists of an Executive Group and a tactical level Coordinating Group, with working sub-groups, mirroring the arrangements in the Local Resilience Forum, allowing the LRF to receive island-specific information and improved joint working between its partners. </p>
<p><strong>ISLAND RESILIENCE FORUM EXECUTIVE GROUP</strong> - &nbsp;&nbsp; This is the strategic co-ordinating group that is responsible for prioritising and directing the multi-agency work required to align with the Strategic Delivery Plan. </p>
<p><strong>ISLAND RESILIENCE FORUM COORDINATING GROUP</strong> - This is the group that coordinates the delivery of the work plan set by the Executive Group. </p>
<h3>List of Plans Produced By Emergency Management</h3>
<p>The Emergency Management Team&nbsp;has produced plans to cater for a number of different emergency situations. These are regularly maintained exercised and updated by the Service to ensure that Council staff can respond effectively to a range of incidents that might affect the Island, and that the response is co-ordinated with that of the Emergency Services and other agencies. </p>
<p>We also hold copies of plans produced by other Isle of Wight Council departments and agencies (not listed) which could be of use in an emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Response Plan</strong> - A generic plan outlining the actions to be taken to respond as quickly and efficiently as possible, to a variety of different scenarios that may affect the Island. </p>
<p><strong>Oil and Chemical Spill Contingency Plan</strong> - Actions to be taken in the event of pollution to the Island&rsquo;s coastline by oil or chemicals. </p>
<p><strong>Pandemic Influenza Response Plan</strong> - To enable the effective planning, response and recovery during a pandemic. </p>
<p><strong>Rest Centre Plan</strong> - This plan is intended as a guide to the arrangements that are necessary for the establishment, activation and management of a Rest Centre to provide temporary accommodation in an emergency. </p>
<p><strong>Fuel Supply Emergency Business Continuity Plan</strong> - In the event of a wide-scale fuel shortage, a means of keeping key services operational as far as possible during any disruption. </p>
<p>Should you require further information about any of these plans, contact the Emergency Management Team using the 'Contact' tab above.</p>
