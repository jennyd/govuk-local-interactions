		<h2>Domestic noise complaint procedure</h2>
<p>Wiltshire Council&#8217;s Environmental Protection Department receive around 3000 complaints about noise every year. &#160;Unwanted noise can cause both stress and sleep disturbance. &#160;The most common noise complaints relate to:</p>
<ul><li>The playing of loud music</li>
<li>Antisocial behaviour</li>
<li>Barking dogs</li>
<li>Intruder alarms</li>
<li>DIY</li></ul>
<p>We also receive a great many complaints concerning commercial or industrial noise. &#160;However a sound being audible in your home does not automatically make it a statutory nuisance and it should not be assumed that it can be resolved by council intervention. </p>
<p>If you are someone who is planning a party or carrying out any DIY or anything else that may disrupt your neighbours then it is strongly recommended that you let them know well in advance of your intentions. Take all reasonable steps to minimise any potential disruption for example: </p>
<ul><li>Control the volume of music even during the day, tastes in music vary and not everyone may share your enthusiasm for your music.</li>
<li>Control the bass level; low frequencies are transmitted further and through structures.</li>
<li>Keep music levels lower after 11pm and not audible outside the property.</li>
<li>Do not play loud music or radios outside </li>
<li>Avoid noisy DIY activities in the evenings, Sundays or bank holidays when others may want to relax.</li></ul>
<h3>Dog barking </h3>
<p>For more information on how dog barking is dealt with, please see our dedicated <a href="communityandliving/publicprotection/animalwelfare/animalwelfarebarkingdogs.htm">Dog Barking page</a></p>
<h3>What is a Statutory Noise Nuisance?</h3>
<p>A statutory noise nuisance is determined under the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The legal definition of what constitutes a statutory nuisance is complex and based on many years of case law. </p>
<p>We need to consider the following key factors when investigating a noise nuisance:</p>
<ul><li>There must be a material interference with the enjoyment and use of the complainant&#8217;s property. &#160;The noise must therefore be considerable.</li>
<li>The noise must substantially affect the enjoyment of comfortable living, such as loss of sleep, interfering with conversation or watching television. &#160;However there would have to be consideration of the time the noise occurs, the intensity of the noise, its character and its duration.</li>
<li>Isolated acts, unless extreme, would not be considered to be a nuisance, for example &#8216;one- off&#8217; parties. The problem must normally be continuous or frequent.</li>
<li>Trivial, harassing or repetitious (vexatious) complaints will not be taken into account. </li>
<li>Any assessment of whether a particular problem amounts to a statutory nuisance is made from the perspective of an ordinary reasonable person. &#160;This means that the council must exclude any personal circumstances or sensitivities of the complainant from our considerations when assessing nuisance.</li>
<li>Factors such as unusual shift patterns, medical conditions or other sensitivities of the complainant cannot be taken into account when we decide whether a particular problem is causing a statutory nuisance. </li></ul>
<p>It is a person&#8217;s basic right to use and enjoy their property. However, there is no right to tranquillity or silence. </p>
<p>The following list outlines some of the common complaints we receive, but cannot deal with under the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
<ul><li>Household noise, for example, shutting doors, walking up and down stairs, children playing, flushing toilets, noise between flats where laminated floors have been installed and so on.</li>
<li>If your complaint is in relation to anti-social behaviour such as shouting, arguments, swearing, verbal abuse, the authority has a dedicated anti-social behaviour team and they may be contacted on 0300 456 0100 </li></ul>
<h3>Stages in investigating a noise complaint </h3>
<p>When a person first contacts Wiltshire Council with a domestic noise complaint, the complainant&#8217;s details and the nature of the complaint are taken by our Technical Support Team and recorded on our computer database.</p>
<h3>Information and evidence gathering</h3>
<h4>Record log</h4>
<p>The first action in this stage is to send a log to the complainant requesting that details of the alleged noise occurrence(s) is/are recorded, (within 5 working days). &#160;The investigation and surveillance has commenced at this stage, and all legal requirements concerning evidence gathering applies from this point. &#160;We would request that you complete the nuisance log over a 14-day period, however, if you do not feel this time period is representative of the noise experienced then we would advise that you contact the investigating officer for further advice. </p>
<h4>Notification of complaint</h4>
<p>A letter will be sent to the person(s) complained of, advising them that a complaint has been received and that officers will be undertaking an investigation. &#160;The complainant&#8217;s identity and the dates of any noise monitoring that will take place will not be discussed with the person or persons being complained about at this stage.</p>
<h4>Receipt of log</h4>
<p>Upon receipt of the completed nuisance log, we will consider a monitoring programme based on the information provided. &#160;Where possible, an officer may undertake programmed visits to the area for the purpose of substantiating your complaint. Alternatively, it may be necessary to install noise recording equipment within your premises. &#160;If the log is not returned without a reasonable explanation within 21 days the complaint will be closed. </p>
<h4>Recording equipment</h4>
<p>There is usually a waiting list for the allocation of recording equipment, and officers will prioritise within the resources available, based on the evidence already collected. &#160;Officers will install noise recording equipment at the noise sensitive property as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>When available, the noise recording equipment will be left at the complainant&#8217;s property, for a period of up to 7 days, or as seen appropriate by the investigating officer. &#160;It is important to note that equipment is normally located inside a dwelling in a habitable room such as a main bedroom or living room. &#160;The complainant&#8217;s co-operation will be required to trigger the recording equipment as and when the noise nuisance is occurring. &#160;This will involve pressing a button when the noise nuisance occurs. &#160;Officers will issue advice and guidance when the equipment is installed. &#160;It is also important that any advice or instruction given by the Officer is adhered to so that any evidence collected is not jeopardised or corrupted. &#160;Please be aware that if the evidence is used by the authority in any formal action then we would require a witness statement from the person operating the equipment to authenticate the evidence.</p>
<h4>Visits</h4>
<p>Officers will usually undertake a maximum of three visits to substantiate your complaint. &#160;If after the three visits no noise nuisance has been established, the council will close the investigation. </p>
<h3>Assessment of evidence</h3>
<p>Upon the return of the equipment the collected data will be analysed to assess whether a statutory nuisance has occurred. On completion of the assessment, the complainant will be advised of the results, and the way forward. The time involved in this stage of the investigation can vary, depending on the complexity of the complaint. &#160;It is necessary on occasions to analyse a significant amount of data, both audio and statistical, especially in the more complex cases. </p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>We will assess the evidence collected and decide if a nuisance is occurring or not. &#160;In many cases the evidence is insufficient, and the investigation of the complaint is ended. </p>
<p>If at any stage you are not happy with the council&#8217;s findings, you can take your own action under Section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and investigating officers will be able to advise you and provide information to the complainant of this procedure. </p>
<p>In cases where the council is satisfied that a nuisance is occurring then a Noise Abatement Notice(s) can be served. A reasonable time will be given to comply with the terms of the notice. Failure to comply with a Noise Abatement Notice(s) is a criminal offence. Once a Noise Abatement Notice has been served the subject has 21 days of appeal and can appeal the terms of the Notice at the magistrates court. However in most cases this does not remove the necessity to comply with the Notice through the appeal period.</p>
<p>When there is reason to believe that a Noise Abatement Notice has not been complied with the council will undertake further monitoring and investigations and will then make a decision on how to proceed. This could result in seizure of a particular items and/or prosecution in the magistrates court. If the person on whom the Notice is served appeals, then the magistrates court again determines the outcome. Court proceedings can introduce delays which can be significant, for example up to 12 months. </p>
<p>In order to achieve a successful appeal/prosecution, complainants will almost certainly have to give evidence in court, in support of any evidence collected by the council</p>
<h3><strong>Action by a private individua</strong>l</h3>
<p>There may be instances where an individual decides they wish to pursue their own action independently of the council. <a href="noise-nuisance_-how-to-take-your-own-legal-action.pdf" target="_blank">This document provides some information on how to do this.</a></p>
