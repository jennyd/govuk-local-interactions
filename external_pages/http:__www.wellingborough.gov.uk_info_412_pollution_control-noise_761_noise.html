        <h1>Noise</h1>
        
        <article>
                <div class="editor">
<h2>Noise complaints</h2> 
 <p>In general terms the council will investigate complaints of noise from the following sources:
</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Domestic noise, from loud music or TVs, DIY, banging etc.</li> 
  <li>Barking dogs/noisy animals</li> 
  <li>House and vehicle alarms</li> 
  <li>Commercial and industrial noise, from pubs and clubs, noisy machinery, early morning deliveries etc.</li> 
  <li>Roadworks and construction sites</li> 
  <li>Noise from equipment in streets</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><strong>We cannot deal with noise from:</strong> </p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Aircraft</li> 
  <li>Traffic</li> 
  <li>Motorcycles in public areas - contact the Police</li> 
  <li>Shouting in the street - Police may assist in serious cases</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h2>Noise problems</h2> 
 <p>Everyone makes noise when going about his or her normal activities. 
Whilst talking to others, playing music, doing DIY, having barbecues and
 driving our cars are all perfectly ordinary activities we must ensure 
that when we carry them out we do not cause a nuisance to others.
</p> 
 <p>In recent years the use of powerful music systems, the trend for 
domestic DIY, dogs being left at home while people are at work, the 
installation of intruder alarms and the rise in the volume of traffic 
have led to a noisier environment.
</p> 
 <p>If you are concerned about noise, which is affecting your life, or 
are keen to ensure you do not cause annoyance to others, then the 
following information is intended to help you.&nbsp;
</p> 
 <h2>Noise nuisance</h2> 
 <p>In all cases we suggest you try talking to the person responsible for
 the noise and discuss the problem. If this is not successful in 
resolving the issue you should report it to the council. The council 
will require information from you before we can commence an 
investigation into whether a statutory noise nuisance exists.
</p> 
 <h3>What is a &#39;statutory noise nuisance&#39;?
</h3> 
 <p>The council must consider whether the noise is a statutory noise 
nuisance. Officers must assess the loudness, time of day, 
reasonableness, how often it happens and for how long it goes on, in 
making their decision. For the council to be able to take formal legal 
action there must be evidence of a serious interference with your 
reasonable peace and quiet. For example to hear a neighbour&#39;s TV or 
stereo during the day may be acceptable, but if it disturbs or prevents 
sleep at night it will not be.</p> 
 <p>There&nbsp;are some noises such as household noises, banging etc. which do
 not last long and&nbsp;are irregular and the council is unlikely to be able 
to prove a nuisance exists. In this case you can complain directly to 
the Magistrates Court, provided you can persuade the court of your case.
</p> 
 <h2>Report a nuisance and noise evidence</h2> 
 <p>You may make your complaint either in writing, by telephone or by completing an <a title="On Line Report Form" href="http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/forms/form/190/noise_complaint">online report form</a>. The&nbsp;<a title="Noise Complaint Guide" href="http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/downloads/file/4161/noise_complaint_guide">noise complaint guide</a>&nbsp;provides information relating to potential stages of a complaint.
</p> 
 <h3>Providing evidence of the noise
</h3> 
 <p>If you are suffering from a noise problem evidence will need to be 
provided to an environmental protection officer, unless you decide to 
take private action, see below.
</p> 
 <p>For an ongoing case this will involve providing nuisance record 
sheets, using audio equipment provided by the council and arranging for 
officers to visit to witness the noise.
</p> 
 <p>There are now opportunities using commonly available household 
devices to supplement this information at any stage of a complaint by 
gathering audio or video evidence at the time the noise is happening and
 providing it to us.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You need to be aware that while this will be very useful 
information it will not allow the officer to determine if the problem 
constitutes a statutory nuisance and officers will need to assess this 
against usual standards.</li> 
  <li>Your evidence needs to be true, to the best of your knowledge and belief, and any recordings must not be fabricated or doctored.</li> 
  <li>When making audio or video evidence of noise, you must try to 
capture the unacceptable noise from your neighbours you witness from 
within your property.&nbsp; You should not risk being accused of snooping on 
them or infringing their human rights.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3>How do I do this?
</h3> 
 <p>Audio and/or visual evidence can be gathered using a number of methods:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>mobile phones (especially smart phones)</li> 
  <li>digital video cameras</li> 
  <li>digital cameras</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Details on how to make a video or audio clip can be found in the 
manufacturer&#39;s instruction manual (either printed or online). This 
evidence can then be uploaded to your computer (via e-mail, cable 
attachment or SD card) and then submitted to us using the <a title="Noise report form" href="http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/forms/form/190/noise_complaint">noise reporting form</a>.</p> 
 <p>There is also a noise nuisance application available for smart phones
 that allow you to record and send an audio recording direct to our 
email address in real time.&nbsp; The file formats you can upload are jpg, 
bmp, gif, jpeg, tif, png, mp3, wav, aif, mid, zip. If you have a problem
 uploading your audio/video clip please let us know by e-mail.
</p> 
 <p>Please note that you should limit each recording to 30 seconds to one
 minute of recording time as larger recording may be difficult for us to
 upload&nbsp; The greater the recording quality, the larger the file size, 
the less recorded time you will be able to upload. If you play your 
recording back on your camera/phone and it doesn&#39;t sound as you would 
expect it to, please send it anyway as when we play it back using 
speakers etc it should be representative of the noise you heard.</p> 
 <h2>Noise emergencies</h2> 
 <p>Whilst you would not have reported a noise nuisance unless it was 
significant to you, most complaints will be dealt with during office 
hours by an approach to the responsible party and an assessment of their
 response to the request to moderate their behaviour. There are some 
instances that the Council will deem as emergencies and will endeavour 
to respond to at any time. These are:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>The prolonged sounding of a house or vehicle alarm during the night-time hours</li> 
  <li>Noise having a significant impact on local residents at night, e.g. a noisy party affecting a number of residents</li> 
  <li>Noise from a licenced premises</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>In these circumstances you should report the problem by 
telephoning 01933 229777&nbsp;&nbsp;and choosing the reporting option. Officers 
will attempt to resolve these problems, however there is no guarantee 
that in these circumstances due to legal and other constraints that the 
problem will be swiftly solved.</p> 
 <h2>What happens if the Council receives a complaint about my dog?
</h2> 
 <p>In the event that the Council receives a complaint about excessive 
barking, it is required to investigate and take appropriate action, this
 is usually by letter or the dog warden may visit you to discuss methods
 of reducing your dogs barking.
</p> 
 <p>Where there is evidence of a serious local nuisance affecting others,
 the Council may have to take further legal action against the owner of 
the dog for not preventing a noise nuisance; this may include 
prosecuting persistent offenders in the Magistrates Court.
</p> 
 <h3>Reason and remedy
</h3> 
 <p>Many dog owners do not realise that while they are at work their dogs are causing a nuisance by constantly whining or barking.
</p> 
 <p>Many people may be at home all day and the barking may be irritating 
and cause a nuisance to you. Such a nuisance may be considered by the 
Environmental Protection Officers at the Council to be statutory 
nuisance which could mean the owner being prosecuted and if the case is 
proven against them, a large fine imposed.
</p> 
 <h3>Advice for dog owners
</h3> 
 <p><strong>The two main reasons why a dog barks:</strong> </p> 
 <p>Lack of good exercise - a trot around the block or back garden is not
 enough. A dog not exercised properly is a stressed animal and can 
change character and temperament.
</p> 
 <p>The most common reason for barking is simply &quot;your dog misses you&quot; 
and wants you back. To the dog you are the pack leader and you have 
left, so the dog barks to get you back.
</p> 
 <h3>Possible cure
</h3> 
 <p>Firstly, your dog needs to associate that what it is doing is wrong. 
The dog needs to associate your words &quot;No Barking&quot; with what it is doing
 - dogs do not have long memories, it takes 5 seconds after doing 
something wrong for a dog to forget its previous actions.
</p> 
 <p>To test this pretend to leave the house and if you hear the dog bark,
 go back, and in strong verbal terms say &quot;No Barking&quot;. After a few 
attempts it will associate the words with its actions. Should it stay 
quiet when tested, give a reward and lots of praise i.e. &quot;Good boy, not 
to bark&quot; etc. Gradually the dog will learn that it is bad to bark as an 
expression of loneliness.
</p> 
 <p>You can stretch the test times so that the dog does not know whether you have gone for a minute or 8 hours!
</p> 
 <p>What the dog will associate with is that barking is &quot;a bad dog&quot; and 
that you, as the owner, might return any minute to catch it out and be 
cross with it. In most cases, it is not the dog that needs training, but
 us!&nbsp;
</p> 
 <p>For further information or assistance with a current situation 
please contact the Borough Council of Wellingborough Environmental 
Protection Team, further information on reducing barking can be found on
 <a title="Is your dog barking too much?" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/is-your-dog-barking-too-much">DEFRA&#39;s</a> website or the Council&#39;s <a title="Barking Dog Leaflet" href="http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/downloads/file/4195/noise-barking_dog_leaflet">Barking Dog leaflet</a>.</p> 
 <h2>Other animal noise</h2> 
 <p> It&#39;s not just barking dogs that can cause a nuisance to surrounding 
neighbours, caged birds and cockerels can be difficult to keep in built 
up areas without causing problems to your neighbours.&nbsp; Each case will 
have to be assessed individually by the Environmental Protection team to
 evaluate if a nuisance is being caused.&nbsp; Please contact the department 
either by phone, email or by completing an <a title="On line reporting form" href="http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/forms/form/190/noise_complaint">online reporting form</a>.
</p> 
 <h2>Alarms</h2> 
 <h3>Property alarms
</h3> 
 <p>Intruder alarms are designed to provide an audible alert and may 
often be heard over a large area. If they have the required 20 minute 
cut out and are attended to that should not pose a problem.
</p> 
 <p>However if they misfire and repeat etc then they may cause a serious problem.
</p> 
 <p>The Council has powers to silence a misfiring alarm including 
entering the property if necessary. The alarm would be disconnected and 
the cost of the works would be charged to the owner.
</p> 
 <p>This can be avoided by registering your alarm on our free 
confidential database and providing 2 keyholders who can attend to 
silence the alarm in your absence.
</p> 
 <p>A form for doing this is available here.
</p> 
 <p><a title="Intruder Alarm Keyholder Details Form" href="http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/downloads/download/562/intruder_alarm_form">Intruder Alarm - Keyholder Detail form </a> </p> 
 <h3>Car alarms
</h3> 
 <p>Misfiring alarms can cause a similar problem.
</p> 
 <p>
To report a noisy alarm contact Environmental Protection or our out of hours service follow the instruction on page 5 above.
 </p> 
 <h2>Construction noise</h2> 
 <p> Building works can be noisy and disruptive. However, with care, jobs 
such as small scale construction, conversion, refurbishment, 
underpinning and even demolition can be carried out without causing too 
much annoyance to neighbours.&nbsp; The Council has extensive powers to 
control noise and other nuisance from building sites further information
 can be found in the Considerate Contractor Advice Note.
