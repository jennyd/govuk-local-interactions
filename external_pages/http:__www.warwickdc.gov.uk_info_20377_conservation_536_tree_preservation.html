and Warwick District Council has the power to make Tree Preservation Orders 
(TPOs) to control the work which is undertaken to trees that make an important 
contribution to the local area. Additionally, trees which fall within conservation areas have a level of protection similar to trees which are covered 
by a TPO.</span></p> 
  <p>In some circumstances it may also be necessary to obtain a felling licence 
from the Forestry Commission before felling trees. </p> 
  <p>This page aims to answer some common questions about Tree Preservation Orders 
and conservation areas. If you plan to fell trees that are not in a residential 
garden you should also refer to the Forestry Commission’s website for 
information on <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6dfk86">felling 
licences</a>.<br /></p>

  <h2>Tree Preservation Orders</h2> 
  <h3>What is a Tree Preservation Order? </h3> 
  <p>A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) is an order made by a Local Planning 
Authority, such as Warwick District Council, which in general makes it an 
offence to cut down, lop, top, uproot, wilfully damage or wilfully destroy a 
tree without first getting permission from the Local Planning Authority.</p> 
  <p>Tree Preservation Orders are usually made to protect trees which make a 
significant contribution to the amenity of an area. They may particularly be 
made when it is felt that a tree may be under threat.</p> 
  <h3>What types of tree can be covered by a TPO? </h3> 
  <p>All types of trees, including hedgerow trees, may be the subject of a TPO. A 
TPO can not protect hedges, bushes or shrubs.</p> 
  <h3>How can I find out if a tree has a TPO? </h3> 
  <p>Contact the <a href="/info/20004/planning/275/planning_-_staff_contacts">council’s Planning Appeals and Enforcement section</a>, with details 
of the address, location and species of the tree. They will be able to tell you 
if the tree is protected.</p> 
  <p>When you are buying a property the presence of a TPO should be revealed by 
the search of the local land charges register.</p> 
  <h3>Who is responsible for maintaining a tree with a TPO? </h3> 
  <p>The owner of the tree is responsible for maintenance of a protected tree, for 
its condition and for any damage which it causes. However, they will need to 
obtain permission from Warwick District Council before carrying out most types 
of work.</p> 
  <p>Tree work is a dangerous and highly skilled operation and tree’s are complex 
structures which are easily damaged by poor or ill advised work. You are 
strongly advised to engage a professional tree surgeon or arborist to advise you 
and undertake any work needed.</p> 
  <h3>Can you recommend a good tree surgeon? </h3> 
  <p>Warwick District Council is unable to recommend any particular tree surgeon 
or arborist but we do provide some <a href="/info/20323/trees/575/choosing_an_arborist">advice on choosing an 
arborist</a>.</p> 
  <h3>How do I get permission to work on a tree covered by a TPO? </h3> 
  <p>If you wish to carry out work to a tree protected by a Tree Preservation 
Order you must make an application on the standard application form. You can do 
this in writing, sending your application to Planning and Engineering, Warwick 
District Council, PO Box 2178, Riverside House, Milverton Hill, Leamington Spa, 
CV32 5QH. Alternatively, you can make an application electronically via the <a title="Link to the Planning Portal" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/">Planning Portal</a>. Please note that 
applications not made on the standard application form can not be accepted and 
will be returned to you.</p> 
  <p>You must include a plan showing exactly which trees you wish to prune, 
although this need not be to scale. You must also indicate exactly what sort of 
work you wish to carry out and the reasons why you wish to carry out the work. 
Certain types of work also require supporting documentation. For example, if you 
give the reason for work as being safety or damage to property you will need to 
provide evidence of these problems. More information about supporting 
documentation can be found in the guidance notes accompanying the standard 
application form.</p> 
  <p>The&nbsp;Application 
form is available for download from the&nbsp;top of this page. It is often helpful if you 
ask your tree surgeon to make the application on your behalf.</p> 
  <p>The District Council will write to confirm the receipt of your application 
and will then consider it and let you know their decision within eight 
weeks.</p> 
  <h3>If I am refused permission can I appeal? </h3> 
  <p>Yes. If your application is refused, or if you do not receive a decision 
within eight weeks, you can appeal to the Planning Inspectorate, who will 
consider your appeal on behalf of the Secretary of State. The District Council 
will send you details of how to appeal along with the decision notice. There is 
more information on making an appeal available from the Further 
information&nbsp;section at the bottom of this page.</p> 
  <p>You may also appeal if the District Council grants permission but attaches 
conditions to it.</p> 
  <p>During the appeal process the information you submitted along with your 
application, along with the council's comments,&nbsp;will be carefully considered by 
an independent inspector.</p> 
  <h3>Can I get compensation if my application is refused, or if conditions are 
attached? </h3> 
  <p>It is sometimes possible to make a claim for compensation if you if you 
suffer loss as a result of being refused permission to carry out work to a 
protected tree, or&nbsp;of conditions&nbsp;being attached to&nbsp;a grant of&nbsp;permission. The 
details of compensation arrangements are complex and you are strongly advised to 
seek legal advice before making a claim for compensation.</p> 
  <p>Some of the main points are:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>no claim can be made if the loss or damage suffered amounts to less than 
£500 
</li> 
    <li>no compensation is payable for loss of development value or other diminution 
in the value of land 
</li> 
    <li>no compensation is payable for loss or damage which, bearing in mind the 
reasons given for the application for consent (and any documents submitted in 
support of those reasons), was not reasonably foreseeable when the application 
was decided 
</li> 
    <li>no compensation is payable to a person for loss or damage which was (i) 
reasonably foreseeable by that person, and (ii) attributable to that person’s 
failure to take reasonable steps to avert the loss or damage or mitigate its 
extent 
</li> 
    <li>no compensation is payable for the costs incurred in bringing an appeal to 
the Secretary of State against the council’s decision to refuse consent or grant 
it subject to conditions </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>If you wish to make a claim for compensation you should write to the District 
Council within 12 months of the council’s decision, or within 12 months of the 
Secretary of State's decision if you appealed.</p> 
  <h3>Will I be told if a TPO is made on a tree on my property? </h3> 
  <p>Yes. When the council makes a TPO it will send copies to the owner of the 
property on which the tree stands&nbsp;and any anyone else with a right to prune the 
tree.</p> 
  <h3>Does a new TPO take effect immediately? </h3> 
  <p>Yes, TPOs take effect as soon as they are made. This initial protections 
lasts 6 months.</p> 
  <p>A new TPO must be made permanent, known as confirming the TPO,&nbsp;within 6 
months of being made, otherwise it will lapse. Owners of affected properties 
will be notified when the TPO is confirmed.</p> 
  <h3>How can I object to, or express support for, a new TPO? </h3> 
  <p>To object to a new TPO, or to express your support for it, write to the 
District Council within the time allowed,&nbsp;which will be at least&nbsp;28 days, after 
the order has been made. The District Council will consider your comments when 
deciding whether or not to confirm the TPO.</p> 
  <h3>How do I go about nominating a tree for a Tree Preservation Order? </h3> 
  <p><span>Email <a href="mailto:planning.enforcement@warwickdc.gov.uk">planning.enforcement@warwickdc.gov.uk</a></span> clearly stating the location of the tree, species, and your reasons for nomination. The council will acknowledge receipt of your nomination, and then visit the site to make its own assessment.</p> 
  <h3>What should I know about TPOs made before 2012?</h3> 
  <p>Since 6 April 2012 the rules set out in all TPOs made prior to that date have 
been replaced.&nbsp;All of the&nbsp;provisions set out in such TPOs are now&nbsp;omitted except 
for those which identify the TPO and those that identify the trees and woodlands 
protected by the TPO. Instead of the provisions in the TPO itself, the 
provisions of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/605/contents/made">Town and 
Country Planning (Tree Preservation)(England) Regulations 2012 </a>apply, as 
they do with more recent TPOs.</p> 
  <h2>Conservation Areas</h2> 
  <h3>What is a conservation area? </h3> 
  <p>A Conservation Area is an area designated by the Local Planning Authority, 
such as Warwick District Council, because of its special character. This is 
usually done because of the special architectural or historical importance of an 
area. </p> 
  <p><a href="/info/20377/conservation">Find 
out more about conservation areas</a>.</p> 
  <h3>How do Conservation Areas affect trees? </h3> 
  <p>Within a Conservation Area all trees have a level of protection similar to 
trees covered by a Tree Preservation Order. </p> 
  <h3>What must I do if I want to work on a tree in a Conservation Area? </h3> 
  <p>Before working on a tree in a Conservation Area you must give the council six 
weeks notice in writing of your intention to carry out work. You should include 
details of the exact location of the tree, usually indicated on a plan, along 
with details of the species and exactly what work you wish to do. Send your 
notification to Planning and Engineering, Warwick District Council, PO Box 2178, 
Riverside House, Milverton Hill, Leamington Spa, CV32 5QH. An Application 
form is available to download at the bottom of this page and it is recommended that you 
use this.</p> 
  <p>The Council will then consider whether or not the tree should be made the 
subject of a Tree Preservation Order. If you have heard nothing within six 
weeks, or if you have received a letter letting you know that the work is 
acceptable, you may go ahead with the work that you notified. If the work is not 
acceptable the council will make a TPO to protect the tree further.</p> 
  <h3>When can I prune a tree in a Conservation Area without notifying the 
council? </h3> 
  <p>All the exemptions listed for protected trees in general apply to trees 
within a conservation area. In addition, there is no need to notify your 
intention to work on trees that:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Have a diameter of less than 75mm (approx 3 inches) measured at 1.5m (appx 5 
feet) above ground. 
</li> 
    <li>Have a diameter of less than 100mm (approx 4 inches) measured at 1.5m above 
ground and are being pruned or felled to help the growth of other trees. 
</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h2>Protected trees in general</h2> 
  <h3>When can I prune a protected tree without permission? </h3> 
  <p>There are a few circumstances in which you can carry out work to a protected 
tree without gaining permission first. These include:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>If the tree is dead or the work is to remove an immediate risk of serious 
harm. The&nbsp;risk must be&nbsp;immediate and the onus will be on you to prove this if 
there are questions.&nbsp;If the tree is protected by a TPO you must give 
the&nbsp;Council&nbsp;at least 5 days written notice unless the danger is imminent. In 
this case you must notify the Council as soon as practical. Removal of dead wood 
from an otherwise healthy tree is also allowed. 
</li> 
    <li>If you are obliged to carry out work by an Act of Parliament. Most commonly, 
this applies to trees that overhang a public road where you have an obligation 
to maintain reasonable clearance above the road. This usually means 2.5m above a 
footway or 5.5m above a vehicular carriageway. 
</li> 
    <li>Where the work is absolutely necessary in order to implement a detailed 
planning permission. Note that this does not apply to outline planning 
permission or to permitted development rights. 
</li> 
    <li>If the tree is a fruit tree and you prune it in accordance with good 
horticultural practice, or if the tree is a fruit tree situated in a commercial 
orchard. 
</li> 
    <li>If the work is to be carried in accordance with a Forestry Commission grant 
scheme or if a felling licence has been granted by the Forestry Commission. 
</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Might I have to plant a replacement tree? </h3> 
  <p>If you cut down or destroy a protected tree you will have to plant a new tree 
if:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>You did so in breach of a TPO or without notifying your intention in a 
Conservation Area 
</li> 
    <li>You did so because the tree was dead, dying or dangerous (except if the tree 
was in a woodland) 
</li> 
    <li>You obtained permission but a condition requiring a new tree to be planted 
was attached to the permission 
</li> 
    <li>In most cases where the Forestry Commission grants a felling licence 
</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>What happens if I carry out work on a protected tree without permission? </h3> 
  <p>If you deliberately destroy a protected tree, or damage it in a manner likely 
to destroy it, you could be fined up to £20,000 if convicted in a magistrates 
court. For other offences you can be fined up to £2,500. Furthermore, you will 
normally have to plant a new tree if the tree was cut down or destroyed.</p> 
  <h3>How else might a tree be protected? </h3> 
  <p>In addition to Tree Preservation Orders and Conservation Areas there are 
various other factors which may constrain work to trees. These include:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Felling which involves more than 5m³ of timber, or more than 2m³ if sold, 
may require a felling licence from the Forestry Commission 
</li> 
    <li>Many wildlife habitats are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 
and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. This includes bats’ roosts and the 
nests of wild birds. If a tree contains a protected habitat work may have to be 
delayed or may require a licence from English Nature. 
</li> 
    <li>Trees may sometimes be protected by virtue of conditions attached to 
planning permission 
</li> 
    <li>Occasionally, restrictive covenants attached to the deeds for a property may 
restrict what work can be undertaken to trees. </li> 
  </ul>
