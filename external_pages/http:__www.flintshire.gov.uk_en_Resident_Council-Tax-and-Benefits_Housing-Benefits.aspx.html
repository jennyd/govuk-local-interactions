<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p><strong> If you're on a low income and finding it difficult to pay all or part of your rent, you may be able to get Housing Benefit. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Who is eligible? </strong></p>
<p>You may get Housing Benefit if you pay rent and your income and capital (savings and investments) are below a certain level.</p>
<p>To work out your Housing Benefit, we will look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money you and your partner or civil partner have coming in, including earnings, some benefits and tax credits and things like occupational pensions</li>
<li>Your savings and your partner's or civil partner's savings</li>
<li>Your circumstances: for example your age, the size of your family and their ages, if you or any of your family are disabled, and if anyone who lives with you could help with the rent</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're entitled to Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or the 'guarantee credit' of Pension Credit you could get maximum help with your rent.</p>
<p><strong> Who isn't eligible? </strong></p>
<p>You can't usually get Housing Benefit if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have savings of over &pound;16,000, unless you are aged 60 or over and getting the 'guarantee credit' of Pension Credit</li>
<li>You live in the home of a close relative</li>
<li>You're a full-time student (unless you're disabled or have children)</li>
<li>You're an asylum seeker or are sponsored to be in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're single and aged under 25 you can only get Housing Benefit for bed-sit accommodation or one room in shared accommodation.</p>
<p>To see if you can get any help and for an estimate of your entitlement you can use our <a class="sys_16" onclick="void(window.open('https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'));return false;" onkeypress="void(window.open('https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'));return false;" href="https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf"> benefits calculator </a> .&nbsp;(Please note, all our forms are compatible with Internet Explorer and Safari, however you may experience issues when using other browsers).</p>
<p><strong> What if I own my home? </strong></p>
<p><strong> Getting help to make your mortgage interest payments.</strong></p>
<p>Homeowners on certain benefits may be able to get help towards mortgage interest payments, called Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI).</p>
<p>You may get help if you are a homeowner and are eligible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income Support</li>
<li>income-based Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance</li>
<li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
<li>Pension Credit</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/"> How To Claim </a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p><a id="LHA"> </a> There is one claim form to complete and you are assessed for both Housing Benefit and Council Tax Reduction at the same time.</p>
<p>If you are claiming for an address in Flintshire, then the form, together with any evidence to support your claim will need to be returned to us. As benefit cannot normally be backdated, you should make your claim as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You can use our on-line <a title="Housing Benefit &amp; Council Tax Benefit, benefits calculator" target="_self" class="sys_16" onclick="void(window.open('https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'));return false;" onkeypress="void(window.open('https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'));return false;" href="https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf"> &lsquo;Benefits Calculator&rsquo; </a> (please note, all our forms are compatible with Internet Explorer and Safari, however you may experience issues when using other browsers)&nbsp;to see if you qualify. &nbsp;If you have capital of &pound;16,000 or more you will not be entitled to benefit unless you are getting &lsquo;Guaranteed Pension Credit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you have recently made a claim for Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance, Pension Credit or Employment and Support Allowance, your claim form for Housing and Council Tax Reduction will usually be completed for you by the Department for Work and Pensions and sent directly to us.</p>
<p><strong> Claim online: </strong></p>
<p>We know that benefit forms can be quite long and complicated, so we have used new internet forms technology to make our on-line application as easy as possible:</p>
<p>&bull; You can fill in the whole form off-line. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if there are any problems with the internet, you can carry on with the form regardless. &nbsp;You don't even have to fill it in all in one go. &nbsp;You can save the form on your computer, and come back to it later.</p>
<p>&bull; The form will help and guide you as you work through it, ensuring that you only fill in parts that are relevant to your claim. &nbsp;This makes the form much simpler to complete.</p>
<p>&bull; The form checks itself for errors and highlights anything you have missed. &nbsp;When your form is free of errors it is easier for us to process.</p>
<p>&bull; When completed, you can submit the form directly to our server so we can begin processing your claim without delay.</p>
<p>&bull; Where we need to see evidence from you to support your claim, the form will give you a customised list of exactly what we need to see.</p>
<p>&bull; To protect your privacy, all information you enter on the form is encrypted.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/"> How It's Paid </a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>If you are a council tenant, we will pay any Housing Benefit straight into your rent account.</p>
<p>If you're not a council tenant the payment will normally be made to you, straight to your bank or building society account.</p>
<p>If you do not already have a bank or building society account, you will need to open one. &nbsp;That way you can arrange to pay the rent to your landlord automatically, using a standing order.</p>
<p>It is up to you to pay the rent to your landlord. &nbsp;If you don't pay rent, you may be taken to court and evicted from the property.</p>
<p>If you are worried about managing your money, contact us to see if we can help you. In some cases, we may be able to pay your benefit directly to your landlord.

<li>To help people through times in which they are stressed and vulnerable</li>
<li>To help to alleviate poverty</li>
<li>To assist people that are particularly disadvantaged by Welfare Reforms</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make a decision the Council will consider the following points;</p>
<ul>
<li>The shortfall between a person&rsquo;s Housing Benefit and their rent</li>
<li>Steps taken by a person to reduce their rent liability</li>

<p>Universal Credit will the normally be paid every month.</p>
<p>If you rent your home, the payment will include an amount for your rent and you will be responsible for paying rent to your landlord.</p>
<p><strong> Flexible Early Payments </strong></p>
<p>If you need to pay an urgent bill before your Universal Credit payment is due, you can ask for a Universal Credit advance. This will only be made if you meet certain conditions. &nbsp;If you receive an advance payment, future payments will be reduced to repay this advance.</p>
<p>To request an Universal Credit advance you will need to contact the Universal Credit helpline on 0845 600 0723.</p>
<p><strong> Alternative Payment Arrangements </strong></p>
<p>Some claimants may need extra help with moving towards a single monthly payment. &nbsp;If you're facing difficult circumstances, you may be able to have Universal Credit paid differently. &nbsp;This is called an alternative payment arrangement. Examples of alternative arrangements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having the housing costs element paid direct to your landlord</li>
<li>Being paid twice monthly instead of monthly</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time you will need to improve how you manage your money, so you can move off alternative payment arrangements and on to the normal Universal Credit payment.</p>
<p>To request an alternative payment arrangement you will need to contact the Universal Credit helpline on 0845 600 0723.</p>
<p>Please note: If you are no longer claiming Housing Benefit because you now claim Universal Credit, you can still apply for Discretionary Housing Payment.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/"> Local Housing Allowance (LHA) </a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>If you are are renting a property or room from a private landlord and you are on a low income, you may be able to claim and receive Local Housing Allowance (LHA).</p>
<p><strong> What is Local Housing Allowance? </strong></p>
<p>Local Housing Allowance is a new way of working out Housing Benefit for people who rent accommodation from a private landlord. It was introduced in April 2008. &nbsp;It applies to new claims for benefit and for customers already on Housing Benefit who change address or move into privately rented accommodation.</p>
<p>If you live in council accommodation or other social housing, such as a housing association, LHA will not affect you unless you move into accommodation rented from a private landlord.</p>
<p><strong> How does Local Housing Allowance work? </strong></p>
<p>The amount of LHA is based on the area that the customer rents in, the number of occupiers in the property and the size of the household. &nbsp;LHA is a fairer way of calculating Housing Benefit, as it ensures that tenants with similar circumstances and living in the same area receive the same amount help with their rent.</p>
<p><strong> How do these changes affect those already on Housing Benefit? </strong></p>
<p>If you are already on Housing Benefit, you will not be affected unless you change address and move into accommodation rented from a private landlord. &nbsp;You would then change over to LHA.</p>
<p><strong> How is Local Housing Allowance calculated? </strong></p>
<p>The Rent Service calculate LHA rates for each individual area or &lsquo;Broad Market Rental Areas&rsquo;, as they are known. &nbsp;The rates vary for each area and also depend on the number of bedrooms in the property. &nbsp;The rates are reviewed monthly.</p>
<p><strong> To work out the maximum LHA rates you need to know: </strong></p>
<p>1) Which bedroom rate you qualify for.</p>
<p>2) The (Broad Market Rental) Area that you will be renting in.</p>
<p><strong> Which bedroom rate do I qualify for? </strong></p>
<p>This is not the number of bedrooms in the property but the number of bedrooms your household actually needs. Follow the link to find out how many bedrooms you qualify for:</p>

<p><strong> Which Broad Market Rental Area am I going to rent in? </strong></p>
<p>You can find out which Broad Market Rental Area you are renting in by using the Post Code search facility on the attached link. Also, by selecting the number of bedrooms you qualify for, you can view the maximum LHA rate that applies.</p>

<p><strong> How much will I actually get? </strong></p>
<p>The LHA rates are the <strong> maximum </strong> benefit you can receive, no matter how much the rent actually is. Remember that LHA is a means tested benefit and that you may get less than the maximum allowance. &nbsp;This will depend on the money you have coming in and any savings you have.</p>
<p>For an estimate of your entitlement you can use our <a title="Information on: benefits calculator" class="sys_16" onclick="void(window.open('https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'));return false;" onkeypress="void(window.open('https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'));return false;" href="https://secure.flintshire.gov.uk/Benefits/Viewer-VicForms.asp?user=anon&amp;Form=HB-CTR%20Calculator%201.0.wdf"> benefits calculator </a> or you can contact us. &nbsp;(Please note, all our forms are compatible with Internet Explorer and Safari, however you may experience issues when using other browsers).</p>
<p><strong> What if my rent is more or less than my allowance? </strong></p>
<p>If the rent you negotiate with your landlord is lower than the allowance you receive, you will be able to keep the difference up to a maximum of &pound;15 per week. &nbsp;This will not normally be taken into account when deciding other benefits.</p>
<p><strong> Please note the following changes from 5 <sup> th </sup> April 2010: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Customers who make new claims or change address on or after 5 April 2010 will not be entitled to keep any excess Housing Benefit over their rent.</li>
<li>Customers already receiving an excess of up to &pound;15 per week will lose this on the anniversary of their claim following 5 <sup> th </sup> April 2010.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the rent is more than the allowance you receive, you will have to pay the difference or look for alternative accommodation.</p>
<p><strong> How to claim? </strong></p>
<p>You can claim LHA as soon as you have a rent agreement with your landlord,if you delay you could lose benefit. &nbsp;You will need to complete our claim form for Housing and Council Tax Benefit. &nbsp;More information is available on how to claim including how to obtain a claim form.</p>
<p><strong> How you are paid LHA? </strong></p>
<p>The payment will normally be made to you, straight to your bank or building society account. Payment is not normally made to your landlord.</p>
<p>If you do not already have a bank or building society account, you will need to open one. &nbsp;That way you can arrange to pay the rent to your landlord automatically, using a standing order. &nbsp;It is up to you to pay the rent to your landlord. &nbsp;If you don't pay rent, you may be taken to court and evicted from the property.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/"> Rent Restrictions </a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>From the 1 April 2013, Housing Benefit will be reduced for working age people who are considered to have &ldquo;spare&rdquo; bedrooms in their Council and Housing Association accommodation. &nbsp;This is determined under new rules.</p>
<p>Under these new rules one bedroom is allowed for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single adult or couple, and</li>
<li>A child, but two children can share a bedroom up to the age of 10 if they are the opposite sex, or 16 if they are the same sex, and</li>
<li>A room is also allowed for a claimant or partner that requires overnight care from a carer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a tenant has one spare bedroom in the house under these rules, then the full rent that their Housing Benefit is calculated on is reduced by 14%. &nbsp;If there is two or more spare bedrooms, the full rent for Housing Benefit is reduced by 25%.</p>
<p>People that have a death in their household are protected from the reduction for 12 months.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/"> Benefit Fraud </a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>Flintshire County Council wants everyone who is entitled to claim benefits to apply for them, but stop those who steal from the system. &nbsp;Fraud has an impact on the amount of Council Tax and income tax you pay and the amount of resources available to the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits are for the needy - not the greedy.</li>
<li>Benefit fraud is theft from everyone, taxpayers and non-tax payers alike. It's theft from those entitled to benefits.</li>
<li>Benefit fraud is not just the Government's business - it's everybody's business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flintshire County Council is committed to protecting public funds through action against benefit fraud and anyone who cheats the benefit system will not be allowed to get away with it.</p>
<p><strong> <span> What is Benefit Fraud </span> </strong></p>
<p>Benefit fraud is where people claim a benefit including Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support they are not entitled to by giving false information or not telling us when their circumstances change.</p>
<p>People who deliberately claim benefit when they are not entitled to it are committing a criminal offence.</p>
<p>Any person who makes a false statement or produces a false document in order to obtain benefit is committing a criminal offence that is punishable</p>
<p>Any person who fails to notify the Council of a change of circumstances in order to continue to receive benefit is committing a criminal offence that is punishable</p>
<p>Flintshire County Council are anxious to ensure that people who are entitled to benefits receive all the help they need.</p>
<p>We do however consider Benefit Fraud to be a serious offence against not only the Council and the Government, but against society as a whole, for this reason we are seriously committed to tackling the issue of Benefit fraud in a professional manner , working to guidelines and legislation laid by the Government</p>
<p>Money lost to Benefit cheats is money that is supposed to be spent on you and on services provided by the Council.</p>
<p>Benefit fraud is a criminal offence involving false claims for Benefits such as Housing Benefit and Income Support. &nbsp;It is a major part of organised crime today.</p>
