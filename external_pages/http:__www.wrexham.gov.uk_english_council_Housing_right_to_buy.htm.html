                <!-- insert content start -->
                <p>Under  the Right to Buy scheme, you can buy your home at a price lower than the full market  value. This is because the length of time you have spent as a tenant entitles  you to a discount. </p>
                <p>These  webpages describe the Right to Buy scheme as it works today. We have tried to  make it easy to understand - but it is  not a substitute for professional advice.</p>
                <p>This webpage is a summary  of the law relating to the Right to Buy. It is not intended to be  comprehensive. If you wish to exercise your Right to Buy, it is recommended  that you seek independent legal and financial advice about your individual circumstances  and to help with the legal process of buying a home. You should also seek  independent financial advice about the different types of mortgages that are  available. </p>
                <p>The Right to Buy is aimed  at secure tenants of local  authorities.</p>
                <div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Warning - Things to Consider Before Deciding To Buy Your Home</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>Buying your home is  probably the biggest financial decision you will ever make. So take time to consider whether it is the  right choice for you. If you exercise the Right to Buy you will become  responsible for all the costs of maintaining your home, including routine  repairs, major structural repairs and improvements to it. If you become a  leaseholder by buying your flat, you will have to pay service charges each year  and also meet the costs of major repairs and refurbishment. </p>
                <p>As a tenant, you may be  able to claim housing benefit to help with your rent. As an owner-occupier, you will not receive any housing benefit to  help with your mortgage costs. </p>
                <p>If you are elderly and  own your home, its value may be taken into account in assessing whether you are  eligible for financial help with the costs of residential care. </p>
                <p>If you need advice on  any aspect of the Right to Buy scheme, contact the Housing Department first. If  you are approached by a person or company offering to help you buy your council  home, check out what&rsquo;s in it for them  and talk to the Housing Department before signing up to any deal. </p>
                <p>People sometimes claim  that the Right to Buy scheme may be changed or ended. In fact the Government is totally committed to the principle of Right  to Buy. But it is concerned that sales are affecting the availability of  affordable housing in some areas, and that the rules are being exploited by  companies. Be suspicious if anyone tries  to tell you that the Right to Buy is going to be ended. They may be trying  to persuade you to do something that benefits them rather than you. </p>
                <p>Sometimes, tenants are  asked to pay a lot of money for things that landlords will do for nothing &ndash; for  example, Right to Buy application forms are available free from the Housing  Department. Some companies offer tenants money up front in a deal under which  the company ends up owning the property &ndash; this is known as a deferred resale  agreement. This is good for the company, which can charge a higher rent than we  could when it lets the property. But it is not always good for tenants, because  the money they get may not be enough to buy another home. Some tenants have found themselves homeless after agreeing to such  deals. Since 18 January 2005, entering into a deferred resale agreement  triggers the repayment of discount at the time that the agreement is  entered into, not the time at which the ownership of the property is  transferred. </p>
                <p>Before agreeing to any  offer or deal, ask who the adviser works for, whether they sell mortgages or  other financial services, and whether he or she gets a commission for selling  you a particular product. </p>
                <p>Before taking out a  loan, be sure you understand what the deal means for you &ndash; in particular:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Read the terms and conditions, including the small  print &ndash; what exactly do they mean?</li>
                  <li>What is the interest rate?</li>
                  <li>What would happen if you missed any of the  repayments due on your loan?</li>
                  <li>What would happen and how much would it cost if you  wanted to repay the loan early?</li>
        </ul>
                <p>Even if you don&rsquo;t need a  mortgage yourself, it is worth checking if your local banks and building  societies will lend on the type of house or flat you are buying. </p></div></div>
                <div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Who has the Right to Buy?</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>You probably have the  Right to Buy if you are a secure  tenant of the Council. </p>
                <p>If your secure tenancy  was in existence before 18 January  2005, or you were a public sector tenant before 18 January 2005 (and you have  been a public sector tenant continuously since that time), you do not have the  Right to Buy until you have spent at least 2  years as a public sector tenant. </p>
                <p>For anyone else, you do  not have the Right to Buy until you have spent at least 5 years as a public sector tenant. </p>
                <p>You will only be able to  purchase under the scheme if your house or flat is your only or principal home. </p>
                <p>You cannot buy your home  if a court makes a possession order which says that you must leave your home.  Neither can you buy your home if you are an un-discharged bankrupt, have a  bankruptcy petition pending against you, or have made an arrangement with  creditors (people you owe money to) and you still owe them money. </p>
                <p>You may be able to  exercise the Right to Buy jointly with members of your family who have lived  with you for the past 12 months, or with someone who is a joint tenant with  you. </p></div></div>
				<div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">The Discount Rules</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>The Right to Buy scheme  gives tenants a discount on the market value of their homes. The longer you  have been a tenant, the more discount you get, <strong>up to a maximum of &pound;8,000</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Qualifying Period</h3>
                <p>Subject to these maximum  limits, the amount of discount for  which you are eligible depends on the time you have spent as a public sector  tenant, with either your present landlord or another &lsquo;Right to Buy landlord&rsquo; </p>
                <p>If you have spent 2  years as a public sector in order to qualify for the Right to Buy (see page 6  to see if that applies to you, the discount available after 2 years is 32% for  houses and 44% for flats. If you are buying a house, you are eligible for 1%  more discount for each extra year, up to a maximum limit of 60%. If you are  buying a flat, you are eligible for 2% more discount for each extra year, up to  a maximum limit of 70%. </p>
                <p>If you have spent 5  years as a public sector tenant in order to qualify for the Right to Buy (see  page 6 to see if that applies to you), the discount available to you after 5  years is 35% for houses and 50% for flats. If you are buying a house, you are  eligible for 1% more discount for each extra year, up to a maximum of limit of  60%. If you are buying a flat, you are eligible for 2% more discount for each  extra full year, up to a maximum limit of 70%. <strong>But, whatever percentage you are eligible for, your discount cannot be  greater than the maximum discount of &pound;8,000</strong>. </p>
                <p>The qualifying period  for discount can include time spent in different homes and with different  landlords. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be continuous, so long as it was a public  sector tenancy. You may also be able to count a period when your husband or  wife was a public sector tenant or lived in housing provided by the armed  forces. If you lived with your parents after the age of 16 and you later became  the tenant of the same house or flat, you may be able to count that time too. </p>
                <h3>Reduction of discount to take account of the cost of work  carried out by your landlord on your home (cost floor)</h3>
                <p>Your discount may be  reduced by a special rule called the cost floor. This may apply if your home  has recently had money spent on it by the Council, in repairing or maintaining  it. Under the cost floor, the discount you receive must not reduce the price  you pay below what has been spent on repairing or maintaining it by the  Council. </p>
                <p>If the cost of works  carried out over the 10-11 year period is greater than the market value of your  home, you will not receive any discount. </p>
                <h3>Repayment of discount</h3>
                <p>If you have bought your  home under the Right to Buy, you can sell it whenever you like. But if you wish  to sell within the &lsquo;<a href="#from">discount repayment  period</a>&rsquo; specified below you will usually have  to <strong>repay some or all of the discount</strong>. The  amount you repay will depend on when you made the application to buy. The  discount charge is registered as if it were a charge by way of legal mortgage.</p>
                <p><strong>If you  applied for the Right to Buy before 18 January 2005 and sell within 3 years of  buying your home.</strong><br />
        If you sell within the first year after your  purchase, the whole of the discount will have to be repaid. Two thirds must be  repaid if you sell in the second year and one third in the third year. After 3  years, you can sell without repaying any discount. The discount is the sum you  actually received when you purchased your home. </p>
                <p><strong>If you  applied for the Right to Buy from 18 January 2005 onwards and sell within 5  years of buying your home.</strong><br />
        If you sell within the first year of purchase, the  whole discount will have to be repaid. Four fifths must be repaid if you sell  in the second year, three fifths on the third year, two fifths in the fourth  year and one fifth in the fifth year. After 5 years, you can sell without  repaying any discount. In addition, the  amount of discount to be repaid if you sell within 5 years of purchase will be  a percentage of the resale value or the property, disregarding the increase of  the amount attributable to any home improvements carried out by you since the  date of your purchase. </p>
                <p>For example, if your home was valued at &pound;100,000 at  the time you bought it from your landlord, and you received a discount of  &pound;20,000, that means that your discount was 20%. </p>
                <p>If your home is valued at &pound;150,000 when you wish to  sell it and you want to sell within the second year of purchase, you will have  to repay &pound;150,000 x 20% discount x 4/5 i.e. &pound;24,000. </p>
                <p>Certain sales or transfers are exempt from the  requirement to repay discount e.g. transfers between certain family members. </p>
                <p>In addition, if you would face severe hardship by  having to repay the discount, and your circumstances justify it, the Council  can decide if requested, not to ask you to pay some or all of the discount that  you owe. </p>
                <p><a id="from"></a>From 18 January 2005, if in advance of your  purchase, or within the &lsquo;discount repayment period&rsquo; you <strong>enter into an agreement to transfer your property to a third party in  the future, then this will trigger repayment of your discount</strong>. Discount  repayment is triggered from the date that you enter into the agreement. So, for  example, if you enter into such an agreement before you have bought the  property or during the first year after buying, you will have to repay the full  amount of discount you received. </p>
                <h3>What  if I have purchased before?</h3>
                <p>If you have purchased under the Right to Buy scheme  before, the amount of discount you received then will usually be deducted from  your discount when you buy again. </p></div></div>
                <div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Right of first refusal</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>If you purchase your home under the Right to Buy  scheme on or after 18 January 2005, and you wish to resell or dispose of it  within 10 years, you will be required to offer it back to either this Council  or to another social landlord in this area at full market value. The market  value must be agreed between the parties or, if they are unable to agree, will be  determined by the District Valuer. </p></div></div>
				<div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Buying a flat or maisonette</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <h3>What are the  differences from buying a house?</h3>
                <p> If you buy a house, you will purchase the freehold  and will own the property outright. If you buy a flat or maisonette, you will  usually purchase a <strong>long lease</strong>. This  allows you and your successors to live it for a fixed time, usually 125 years.  The block will still be owned by the Council, and we will be responsible for  the upkeep of the building as a whole and of any communal areas and facilities. </p>
                <p>As a leaseholder, you only have to pay the Council  a nominal rent (known as a &lsquo;ground rent&rsquo;) of &pound;10 a year. But you and other  leaseholders <strong>will also have to pay the  service charges</strong>.&nbsp; These can be  perhaps several hundred pounds each year, or much more if the block needs major  repairs or maintenance, such as a new roof, structural repairs, alterations and  adaptations required by statute and improvements. </p>
                <p>Leaseholders can sell their properties at any point  during the lifetime of the lease. The person who buys it pays to take over the  remainder of the lease. </p>
                <p>Under your lease:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your Council will be responsible for  repairing the structural and outside of your flat and the rest of the building.  This includes routine repairs and maintenance, and also major maintenance and  refurbishment works (for example, repairing the roof or replacing a lift),  which can be very expensive. </li>
                  <li>Your Council will usually provide  services like communal lighting </li>
                  <li>You will have to pay a  reasonable share of the costs for these works and services. Your share is determined  by the number of flats or maisonettes in the block.</li>
                  <li>You will usually have to  pay a  charge towards the Council&rsquo;s costs of managing the block &ndash; often calculated as  a percentage of the charges for services and maintenance. </li>
                  <li>You will also be  responsible for  keeping the inside of your flat in good repair. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Service  Charges</h3>
                <p>There are two kinds of service charges: <strong>annual charges</strong> for day to day  repairs/maintenance and &lsquo;major works&rsquo;  service charges (a lump sum, which can be &pound;20,000 or even more) when a lot of  repair or refurbishment work is needed. </p>
                <p>If you decide you want to buy, your Council must  tell you how much the property will cost and he must also give you an estimate  of any service charge you will have to pay <strong>during  the first 5 years of your lease</strong>. If  the lease says you must pay some of the costs of improvement, the estimate must  cover these too. Once we have given you an estimate, we are not allowed to  charge you more than that figure during the first 5 years of your lease, except  to take account of inflation. </p>
                <p><strong>There is no  special limit on charges for repairs carried out after the first 5 years</strong>. You need to remember that  you may have to pay &lsquo;major work&rsquo;&rsquo; service charges whenever your block is  repaired. There are several schemes to help you with this &ndash; ask us about them. </p>
                <h3>Other  points on service charges</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>The  estimate of service charges before you buy will also cover charges for building  services such as caretaking. But charges  of this kind can change, even during the first 5 years of a lease. </li>
                  <li>You  will also be told about any unknown structural defects affecting the building.  If we require you to pay for work to put them right during the first 5 years,  the estimate of service charges for repairs must cover this. But you may also have to pay for some of  the costs of work done after the first 5 years. </li>
                  <li>You  may have the right to a loan from your landlord to help pay a service charge  for repairs during the first 10 years of your lease. The service charge bill  will say if a loan is available.</li>
                </ul></div></div>

                <h2><a class="acc_button">The costs of buying</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>Buying your home is a major  financial commitment. Apart from paying for it , you will then have to maintain  it. As explained, if you buy a flat on a long lease, you will also have to pay  service charges. </p>
                <p>Unless you are going to buy  your home with cash, you will need a mortgage. There are various kinds of  mortgages which your bank or building society can tell you about. An  independent advisor may also be able to help. </p>
                <p>If you can&rsquo;t keep up the  repayments on your mortgage, the lender may go to court and ask that you be  removed from your home. The council does not have to give you another tenancy  if you lose your home in this way. </p>
                <h3>Other  regular costs of home ownership</h3>
                <p><strong>Council tax  and water charges</strong><br />
        If you buy your home, you will have to pay these separately, straight to the water  services company and to the council. </p>
                <h4>Utility  Services</h4>
        <p>When budgeting you must take into account the gas,  electricity, telephone and personal bills that still have to be paid for when  you own your property.</p>
                <h4>Insurance</h4>
       <p> You will need to consider taking out insurance  cover for your home and mortgage. There are four main types:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Buildings insurance<br>
This is essential. It is  needed to cover the full cost of rebuilding your home if it were to be destroyed  by fire or some other incident. In the case of flats, this insurance is often  arranged for the whole block by us, and we will expect you to contribute  towards the cost of the insurance premium. If you need a mortgage to help buy  your home, the lender will insist that you have buildings insurance.</li>
                  <li>Contents insurance -<br>
                As well as buildings  insurance, you should insure the contents of your home against theft and other  risks. </li>
                  <li>Life insurance -<br>
                This is needed to pay off  your mortgage if you die before the end of the mortgage period. It means that  your family is not left with the heavy burden of mortgage debt.</li>
                  <li>Mortgage payment protection  insurance - <br>
You need to think seriously  about how you would meet your mortgage repayments if you lost your income, say  through unemployment or ill-health. In many cases, mortgage payment protection  will give you the security that you need. </li></ul>
                <p>You should  shop around for policies that best suit your needs. </p>
                <h3>Repairs  and maintenance</h3>
                <p>If your home is a house and you buy it, you will be  responsible for the costs of all repairs and maintenance, regardless of the  condition of the property when you bought it. If you are buying a flat on a  long lease, you will have to pay the landlord&rsquo;s service charges. It is your responsibility to get advice on  the condition of your home before you complete the purchase. </p>
                <h3>One  off costs of buying your home</h3>
                <p>You should employ a solicitor or a licensed  conveyancer to look after the legal side of buying your home. Before employing  anyone, always ask how much their advice will cost and amount of disbursements  they will incur on your behalf in purchasing your home. </p>
                <p>You should have a survey of your home done. You  should consider one of these:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A RICS Homes Buyers&rsquo; Survey  and Valuation<br>
This is a report and  valuation in a standardised format, to tell the buyer of all the significant  defects, but not minor ones. It is likely to be adequate for most properties  and provides a guide to value.</li>
                  <li>A Building Survey<br>
This involves a detailed  examination of all the visible parts of the property. It is a good idea to have  such a survey done if the property is old, or obviously in need of repair, or  if you are considering making alterations.</li></ul>
                <p>Your lender may be able to arrange for its valuer  to carry out the survey, which could save you paying for a separate valuation. </p>
                <p>You should get a survey done after you receive your  section 125 notice&nbsp; You should ask how  much it will cost before you ask anyone to go ahead with the survey. </p>
                <p>When a sale is completed, you must pay the Land  Registry to register you as the new owner. </p>
                <p>You may have to pay Stamp Duty Land Tax, which is a  tax that people pay when they become home owners. Stamp Duty Land taxis worked  out as a percentage of the price you pay for a property that is worth more than  &pound;120,000. </p></div></div>
				<div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">How do I apply? (A step by step guide)</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>This section aims to take you through each stage of  the process of buying your home. </p>
                <h3>Step 1 &ndash;  Applying to buy</h3>
                <p> Start by contacting the Council&rsquo;s right to buy  section or housing estate office and this can be done either in writing or by  telephone requesting a Right to Buy  claim form (Form RTB1). &nbsp;We must provide  this free of charge. </p>
                <p>Fill the form in carefully. It is used to decide:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Whether  you have the Right to Buy; and</li>
                  <li>How  much discount you will get. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you have filled in the form, return it to the  right to buy team. </p>
                <h3>Step 2 &ndash; The  Council&rsquo;s Response Notice</h3>
                <p> Having received your claim form, we will send you a  notice (Form RTB2) telling you  whether or not you have the Right to Buy. You should get this within 4 weeks  from the date on which your landlord received your RTB1 form </p>
                <p>If we determine that you don&rsquo;t have the Right to  Buy your home, we must explain why. The property may be one of the exceptions  listed below. If you don&rsquo;t agree with his explanation, you can get advice from  a Citizens Advice Bureau or from a solicitor. If you are still not satisfied,  you can write to the Welsh Assembly Government at the addresses given in this  booklet. </p>
                <h3>Step 3 &ndash; Your  landlord&rsquo;s Section 125 Notice</h3>
                <p> If we agree to sell your home to you, we must send  you a separate offer notice (known as the Section 125 Notice) which tells you  the price you have to pay and the terms and conditions of the sale. He must  send this within a further 8 weeks after you have received your RTB2 form if  your home is a house and you are buying a freehold, or within 12 weeks if your  home if a flat or maisonette.</p>
        <p>The section  125 Notice is an important document and you should read it very carefully. It will tell you five main things:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It  will describe the property which you  have the Right to Buy.</li>
                  <li>It  will tell you the price we think you  should pay for it. </li>
                  <li>It  will give estimates of the service  charges or improvement costs you will have to pay during the first 5 years  after you buy your home, if it is a flat or maisonette. </li>
                  <li>If  will describe any structural defects  that the landlord knows about.</li>
                  <li>It  will contain the terms and conditions that  we feel should be attached to the sale. These may be set out either in the form  of a draft of the legal document for you to sign, or as part of the notice, or  on a separate sheet.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 4 &ndash;  Appealing to the District Valuer</h3>
                <p> When you receive your Section 125 notice, you may  feel that what we think is the full market value of your home is too high. If  so, you have a right to obtain an independent valuation from the District  Valuer. Before doing so, you have to tell us, within 3 months of receiving the Section 125 notice, that you want  a &lsquo;determination of value&rsquo; under Section 128 of the Housing Act 1985. You then  have 4 weeks to put your case to the  District Valuer. He will also need to  inspect your home. </p>
                <p>The District Valuer&rsquo;s valuation will be the one  that counts. Even if it is higher than our  valuation, you will still have to accept it or withdraw your application to buy  your home. </p>
                <h3>Step 5 &ndash;  Getting a Survey</h3>
                <p> Before you finally decide to buy, you should get an  independent survey form a qualified surveyor. When you apply for a mortgage,  the bank or building society will have a survey done, but this is only to value  your home. It may not uncover any structural problems that may exist..</p>
                <h3>Step 6 &ndash;  Getting legal advice</h3>
                <p> Before deciding whether to buy, you could get legal  advice, particularly if you have worries about the terms of the sale. </p>
                <h3>Step 7 &ndash;  Telling us what you want to do next</h3>
                <p>The information contained in your Section 125  notice may not be straightforward and easy to understand. You will now have to  decide if you want to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Buy  your home outright for the full Right to Buy price, less any discount for which  you are eligible;</li>
                  <li>Forget  about buying, withdraw your application and carry on paying rent. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you have decided, you must tell us in writing.  You must let him know your decision  within 12 weeks of receiving your Section 125 notice. If you have asked to have  your house valued by the District Valuer, you must tell us what you want to do within 12 weeks of getting that valuation. </p>
                <p>If you do not let us know what you intend to do in  time, we will send you a reminder. If you do not reply within 28 days, we will  think you don&rsquo;t want to buy and your  application will not be dealt with any further. </p>
                <h3>Step 8 &ndash;  Completing your purchase</h3>
                <p> If you are happy with our terms for selling your  home to you, and you have arranged to raise the money, you are ready to go  ahead and buy. You should tell us that you are ready and ask your solicitor for  advice on the legal documents and making your payment </p>
                <p>It is at this stage, when your acceptance is  received by us that your file will be passed to the Council&rsquo;s legal department  to enable the documentation to be prepared and forwarded to your appointed  legal representative. Attached to the document is a plan of your property and  this will have been prepared after a site visit by an Officer from the Property  Planning Department. The plan shows the area of land included in your tenancy  and the boundary responsibility you will have once you have purchased.</p>
                <p>If we don&rsquo;t hear from you, you may get a warning  notice. This will ask you either to complete the purchase within 8 weeks or to  write and tell us that you disagree with the terms of the sale. If you don&rsquo;t, we  may send you a second notice asking you to complete your purchase. <strong>If you then don&rsquo;t complete, your  application will not be taken any further and it will be deemed withdrawn.</strong> </p>
                <p>We cannot send you a warning notice until at least  3 months (or 12 months if you have applied for the Right to Buy before 18 January 2005) after your  Section 125 notice. </p></div></div>
                <div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Delays or problems with the sale</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>Most sales go through quickly, but sometimes there  are problems or delays. If we do not send your Form RTB2 (the notice telling you if you have the Right to Buy) or  the Section 125 notice (offer  notice) within the times mentioned in the step by step guide, or is otherwise  delaying the sale, you may be allowed to get a reduction in the purchase price.  To get this reduction, you first need to fill in an initial notice of delay (Form RTB 6) and send it to us. You must  give us at least one month to take the next step in the sale process. We may  send you a counter notice if we have  already served you with a Response Notice or a Section 125 Notice, or if there  is no action that can be taken by us to speed up the sale. </p>
                <p>If we do not send you a counter notice within the  time allowed, you can send us an  operative notice of delay (Form RTB 8). The rent you pay while the delay  goes on will then be taken off the price you have to pay for your home. If we  delay the sale again, you can repeat this procedure. </p>
                <p>You can get the forms mentioned above from us, or  the Welsh Assembly Government. </p></div></div>
				<div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Exceptions to the Right to Buy</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <h3>Homes  suitable for occupation by the elderly</h3>
                <p>We may refuse to let you buy on the grounds that  your home is particularly suitable for occupation by elderly people (under  paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985). If so, you can ask the  National Assembly for Wales to decide if we are right. But you must ask them within 56 days after we have refused to sell your  home. If you don&rsquo;t ask in time, you lose this right of appeal. </p>
                <p>You do not have the Right to Buy if your home:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Is  particularly suitable for occupation by elderly persons, taking into account  its location size, design, heating system and other features;</li>
                  <li>Was  let to you or the previous tenant for occupation by a person aged 60 or over, whether  they were the tenant of not; and </li>
                  <li>Was  first let (to you or someone else) before 1 January 1990. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When considering if your home is &lsquo;particularly  suitable&rsquo;, we must ignore features that you have provided (for example, a  central heating system). </p>
                <h3>How do you  ask for a decision?</h3>
                <p> Write to the Welsh Assembly Government, Housing  Directorate, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ. </p>
                <h3>What happens  next?</h3>
                <p> When both sides have had the chance to put their  case and the facts have been established, the National Assembly for Wales will  decide whether or not your home is excluded from the Right to Buy. </p>
                <h3>What effect  will the decision have?</h3>
                <p> If the Welsh Assembly Government decides that your  home does fall within the criteria set out in paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 to the  Housing Act 1985, you will not have the right to buy. </p>
                <p>If the decision is that paragraph 11 does not apply  to your home, you will be able to go ahead with your purchase unless there is  some other reason why you do not have the Right to Buy (we may have denied the  Right to Buy for more than one reason). </p>
                <h3>On what basis  will the decision be made?</h3>
                <p> The decision-maker will normally expect to be  satisfied on the following points:<br />
                  a)&nbsp;there should be easy access on foot to  your home: access is unlikely to be regarded as easy if it is necessary to  climb three or more steps (in addition to the threshold) and there is no  handrail;<br />
                  b)&nbsp;the  accommodation should normally be on one level;<br />
                  c) in the case of a flat above ground floor  level, there should be easy access by lift;<br />
                  d) there should be no more than two bedrooms<br />
                  e)&nbsp;there should be heating arrangements which  function reliably and provide heat to at least the living room and one bedroom;<br />
        f)&nbsp;your home should be located reasonably  conveniently for shops and public transport, having regard to the nature of the  area.</p>
                <p>The Welsh Assembly Government will also take into  account any other relevant features of your home which are drawn to their  attention. </p>
                <h3>Homes due to  be demolished</h3>
                <p>If we intend to demolish your home, we may serve on  you an initial demolition notice, valid  for up to 5 years. Such a notice suspends  our obligation to complete a Right to Buy purchase. If you have already applied  for the Right to Buy, you can still complete if demolition does not in fact take place. You can also make a new  application while an initial demolition notice is in force, but we do not have  to complete the sale under those circumstances. </p>
                <p>However, if we serve a final demolition notice, then any existing Right to Buy claims are  ended and no new applications can be made. </p>
                <h3>Other  exceptions to the Right to Buy</h3>
                <p>There are other exceptions to the Right to Buy. A  full list of these exceptions is available in the ODPM publication &lsquo;Your Right  to Buy Your Home&rsquo; booklet which can be obtained from your local housing estate  office or Housing services in Ruthin Road, Wrexham&nbsp; </p>
                <h3>Rural restrictions</h3>
                <p>If your home is an area designated by the Secretary  of State or Welsh Assembly Government as rural and you want to buy your home  from the council under the Right to Buy, special rules apply. </p>
                <p>When you buy, the sale will be on the condition  that you may only resell it to someone who has been living or working in the  area for 3 years. Alternatively, we may require you to offer your home back to us  if you want to resell within 10 years of buying (see the section on the &lsquo;Right  of first refusal&rsquo; for further information). The landlord would then have to pay  you the full value of the property. </p>
                <p>You may find  it difficult to get a mortgage for your home because of these restrictions on  resale. </p></div></div>
                <div class="accordion">
                <h2><a class="acc_button">Defective dwellings</a></h2>
                <div class="acc_content">
                <p>Certain types of houses and flats have been  designated as defective under Part 16 of the Housing Act 1985, because:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>They  are defective by reason of their design or construction; and</li>
                  <li>Their  value has been reduced substantially because their defects have become  generally known.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your home is one of these, we must tell you before you buy. Usually this is done by way of  letter to you. You should then consider very carefully whether it is wise to  buy. You might have difficulty in selling later, because anyone thinking of  buying your home from you might be unable to get a mortgage. If you do decide  to buy, it is very important to find out the structural condition of your home. </p></div></div>
