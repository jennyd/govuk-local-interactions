If this is through employment we will need to see your employment contract. If this is through residence we will need to see evidence of how long you have lived in the area. Without this evidence you will be skipped for any properties where a rural connection is required.&nbsp; <br />The process of updating 1300 applications will be rather time consuming so the allocaitons officers will be largely unavailable to take calls over the next fortnight, however if you are not able to speak with an officer&nbsp; and need to establish anything in relation to your application please send us a&nbsp;user message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.<br />Thank you for your patience - Kirsty Jones, Housing Options Manager</h4>

<h4><strong>On the 11th September the following things will therefore happen;</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>All&nbsp;applications already on the register will be moved to a state of 'online incomplete'. You will see this when you log on and go into your summary page</strong></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><strong>All households will then need to go through the application and update all&nbsp;areas which have been added.&nbsp; </strong></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLEASE PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL CONNECTION PAGES -</span><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Under our new allocations policy, properties advertised in named rural areas will have a priority given to people with a local connection to those areas unless there is a band 1 person in need of the accommodation.&nbsp; (Adverts for these properties will show a tree with the letters LC after it).<strong>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY</span> to be able to evidence that you have a certain local connection</strong>.&nbsp; Where this local connection is through a&nbsp; family member we will need to evidence that they are your family member.&nbsp; This will mean in the case of parents, being able to provide your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full </span>birth certificate.&nbsp; In the case of employment we will require a letter from your employer confirming your employment in the area and the number of hours that you work for them in the area.&nbsp;</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you wish to send in proof of local connections to areas now please do so as we can add them to your files in advance.&nbsp; </span>We will still need you to update your application when the policy goes live however it would help us to be able to have as much information now as possible.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Once you have updated the application and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>pressed submit </strong></span>it will come back to the HomeChoice Officers at the Council to verify.&nbsp; Only once it has been verified will you again be able to bid upon properties.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Any changes in banding as a result of the policy changes will NOT be backdated.&nbsp;</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>People who owe monies to the Council or rent to other landlords will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">removed </span>from the housing register until they have made a payment plan which they have kept for 12 regular payments.&nbsp;</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>We will not be advertising any properties for three weeks starting 4th September&nbsp;to enable us to concentrate on verifying and updating the applications which people update.&nbsp; After these three weeks we will again start advertising properties but only those people who have logged on and updated their application will be able to bid upon properties.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Where households have notified us in the past that they&nbsp;do not have acces to computers and we are already autobidding for them we will be contacting them to assist them with this process.</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Please&nbsp;be patient with us during this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have over 1200 applications which we need to work through in order to update our housing register with the new allocations policy and so all our efforts will be put towards doing this as efficiently and effectively as possible.&nbsp; This will mean that we may not be easily available to answer all your queries during this time although we will do our best.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Many thanks - Kirsty Jones, Housing Options Manager</h4>

<p><strong>Have you tried the Options Wizard?</strong></p>
<p>On 21 November 2013 Mole Valley launched its new online Housing options wizard service. The wizard does not replace face to face contact, but will give you an idea of&nbsp;which housing options may be available to you. These may not include social housing. Social housing is in great demand and often people can wait a long time before being offered a social housing property. Housing options are often the alternatives to social housing that may make it easy and quicker for you to find somewhere to live.&nbsp;Some options do require you to make an appointment to see a member of the housing options team.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Further to our news items on the 22nd March&nbsp;and the 1st August we will be going live with our amended allocations policy on 15th August 2013.&nbsp; The main changes are in relation to the number of bedrooms that a household will be eliglbe for after considering the age of the household members.&nbsp; These will be the same as the number allowed&nbsp; by housing benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The housing benefit rules allow for one bedroom for each of the following;</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">a couple</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">a person who is aged 16 or over</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">two children of the same sex under 16 years old</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">two children of different sex under 10 years old</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">a carer providing regular overnight care</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">
<p>There <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> also be allowances made for families with disabled children where they are in receipt of Disability Living Allowance and for foster carers, however this is still to be clarified by the Government.&nbsp; Households where there is a recommendation for an extra bedroom based on medical needs will need to be considered on an individual basis , as they may not be automatically entitled to Housing Benefit for that extra bedroom.&nbsp; The amended housing allocations policy can be found on the housing pages of the&nbsp;Council's main website.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A transitional scheme will be implemented for some eligible households affected by the changes.</span></span></span></span></p>
