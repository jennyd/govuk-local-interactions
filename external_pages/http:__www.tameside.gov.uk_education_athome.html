<h3><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>The intention of these notes is to help families understand what may be involved if they are considering educating their child or children at home. The information, which follows, should clarify the procedures in Tameside.</p>
<p>There are a number of questions, which families ask regularly when they are considering educating at home. The following examples are included to assist you in making an informed decision as to whether home education is an appropriate alternative to school for your child or children.</p>
<h3><a name="2"></a>Do children have to go to school?</h3>
<p>The 1996 Education Act states that it is the duty of parents to secure an appropriate education for their children. This can be done either by regular attendance at school, or 'otherwise'. For most children in Tameside this means that they will attend their local school but for various reasons, a small number of parents decide to take on 'the responsibility to educate their children outside the school system.</p>
<h3><a name="3"></a>How many other parents are educating their children in Tameside?</h3>
<p>There are approximately&nbsp;65 children out of a total school population of approximately 35,000 being educated by their parents in Tameside. Some do it themselves and some do it cooperatively with other parents, neighbours and/or tutors. Some use materials and ideas from outside agencies.</p>
<h3><a name="4"></a>What is the parents' duty?</h3>
<p>Under Section 7 of the Education Act 1996, it is the parents' duty:</p>
<p><em>"... to cause (the child) to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his (or her) age, ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he (or she) may have either by regular attendance at school or 'otherwise."</em></p>
<p>Parents who decide to home-educate their child who is registered at a school must inform the school formally, in writing, of their intention to de-register - Section 8(1) (d) of the Education (Pupil Registration) Regulations 2006.</p>
<p>Parents should be aware that if they choose to home-educate, they assume financial responsibility for their child's education, including the cost of public examinations, and that the child must continue to receive suitable education until the end of 'compulsory education' i.e. the last Friday in June of the academic year that they reach age 16.</p>
<h3><a name="5"></a>What is 'efficient' and 'suitable' education?</h3>
<p>It is up to parents to show the Local&nbsp; Authority (LA) that they have a programme of work in place that is helping their child to develop according to his/her age, ability and aptitude and any special educational needs he/she may have.</p>
<p>The LA would expect the home education provision to take account of the 5 outcomes that form the cornerstone of the Children Act 2004:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">Being healthy</li>
    <li title="*">Staying safe</li>
    <li title="*">Enjoying and achieving</li>
    <li title="*">Making a positive contribution;</li>
    <li title="*">Achieving economic well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also include the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">Consistent involvement of parents</li>
    <li title="*">Evidence that that parents have thought through their reasons for home education</li>
    <li title="*">Shows signs of commitment and enthusiasm, and recognition of the child's needs, attitudes and aspiration</li>
    <li title="*">Opportunities for the child to be stimulated by their learning experiences</li>
    <li title="*">Involvement in activities appropriate to the child's stage of development</li>
    <li title="*">Access to resources such as libraries, physical activity, ICT and the opportunity for interaction with other children and adults</li>
    <li title="*">Access to materials such as paper and pens, books, art and crafts materials etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, on considering the education provision, one or more of the above characteristics appear to be lacking, the LA may choose to further investigate whether or not a suitable and efficient education is, in fact, being provided. If the LA is not satisfied that this is being provided, the parents will be given a reasonable opportunity to improve their provision and report back to the authority. Failure to improve provision could result in the LA instituting formal attendance procedures in accordance with the provisions of section 437 of the Education Act 1996.</p>
<p>It is up to parents to show the LA that the programme of work is helping each child to develop according to his/her age, ability and aptitude and any special educational needs he/she have.</p>
<h3><a name="6"></a>What is 'full-time' education?</h3>
<p>The length of time is not specified but 'full-time' education in school means that children spend between 23-25 hours on work each week, plus homework, according to age. Children attending state schools attend for 38 weeks a year.</p>
<h3><a name="7"></a>What if my child has an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)&nbsp;or&nbsp;statement of Special Educational Needs?</h3>
<p>Parents of a child who has an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) or&nbsp;statement of Special Educational Needs (SEND) can educate their child at home. However, where a child attends a Special School, the consent of the LA is required before the school can remove the child's name from the register. The LA cannot refuse consent without good reason. The LA may ask for more information before the child's name can be removed from the school register.</p>
<p>Where a child has a statement of special educational needs and is educated at home, the LEA retains the duty to ensure that the child's needs are met. The statement must remain in force and the LEA must ensure that parents can make suitable provision, including provision for the child's SEN. The LA must maintain the statement and review it annually.</p>
<p>Parents who choose to educate their child at home may ask the LEA to carry out a statutory assessment of their child&rsquo;s special educational needs and the LEA must consider the request within the same statutory timescales and in the same way as all other requests.</p>
<h3><a name="8"></a>What is the National Curriculum and does it apply to me?</h3>
<p>The National Curriculum does not apply to children educated at home but you may wish your child to enter or re-enter state education at some point in the future. Reintegration will be easier if you take the requirements of the National Curriculum into account. The Education Act 1996 states that every maintained school will, in future, be obliged by law to provide a basic curriculum consisting of religious education and, for pupils of compulsory school age, the National Curriculum.</p>
<p>The curriculum in Tameside schools must:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">be broad and balanced;</li>
    <li title="*">promote the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at school and of society;</li>
    <li title="*">prepare pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experience of adult life.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following subjects are compulsory in Tameside schools:</p>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">Religious education (unless parents exercise their right to withdraw their child)</li>
    <li title="*">English</li>
    <li title="*">Mathematics</li>
    <li title="*">Science</li>
    <li title="*">Technology</li>
    <li title="*">History</li>
    <li title="*">Geography</li>
    <li title="*">Art (not compulsory beyond age 14)</li>
    <li title="*">Music (not compulsory beyond age 14)</li>
    <li title="*">Physical education</li>
    <li title="*">A modern foreign language (from age 11)</li>
    <li title="*">Work related learning and enterprise education (beyond age 14)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that young children acquire their learning in many different ways; in the primary school, the curriculum will possibly not be taught as separate subjects but will be delivered through integrated and whole-curriculum activities. In secondary schools it is most likely that the subjects will be taught separately.</p>
<p>What you teach and how your child learns is up to you provided that you can describe the ways in which the education is appropriate.</p>
<p>There is no one form of education; children learn in many ways, at different rates and from a range of people. Education does not always have to follow a set pattern of 'lessons' or even a timetable. However, it is good to identify your long term plans and the ways in which you intend to achieve them.</p>
<h4>Success is more likely if you consider the following suggestions:</h4>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">Try to see that the learning process is as <strong>active, practical, participative </strong>as possible and <strong>systematically planned.</strong></li>
    <li title="*">Try to take full advantage of all the <strong>resources </strong>available around you.</li>
    <li title="*">Give great importance to <strong>reading </strong>in your programme.</li>
    <li title="*">Have a programme of <strong>educational visits </strong>planned. Make sure they are <strong>prepared in advance </strong>and followed up afterwards.</li>
    <li title="*">Education material available on television and internet can also be a valuable resource.</li>
    <li title="*">Provide opportunities, which help with physical development, and ones which allow <strong>social interaction </strong>to take place in different contexts.</li>
    <li title="*">Make your approaches to learning more <strong>enjoyable </strong>by <strong>varying </strong>the style and content, and processes it involves.</li>
    <li title="*">When necessary, give opportunities for <strong>independent study and research </strong>, and provide a quiet area for sustained study/work.</li>
    <li title="*">Public examinations and regular testing are available to children in schools and colleges. Participation in public examinations will assist in assessing progress and provide evidence&nbsp;of&nbsp;achievement.&nbsp;</li>
    <li title="*">Consider progression beyond the age of 16. <strong>Careers guidance </strong>is readily available for young people who are being educated at home - we can give you advice on whom to contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="9"></a>How do I go about it?</h3>
<p>If your child is of pre-school age then you do not need to do anything - though it would help us considerably in keeping track of those who are being educated at home if you were to write to the LA, stating that you intend educating your child (name, date of birth, address and telephone number), at home from, a particular date.</p>
<p>If your child is of statutory school age and is registered as a pupil in a Tameside school, simply write to the Headteacher of the school stating that you intend to educate your child at home. The Headteacher is&nbsp;required to notify the LA within 10 days of receiving your letter.</p>
<p>Parents may choose to employ other people to educate their child but they will still continued to be responsible for the education provided. They will also be <strong>responsible for ensuring that those whom they engage are suitable persons to have access to children. </strong>Parents will therefore wish to satisfy themselves by taking up appropriate references, including Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) checks to ensure that the person engaged is suitable for working with children.</p>
<h3><a name="10"></a>How will the LA ensure that the provision is satisfactory?</h3>
<p>The LA will write to you with a proposal form so that we can establish how you intend to go about home education for your child. An Education Adviser and an Education&nbsp;Welfare Officer will then contact you direct to make an appointment to visit, to check that your arrangements are satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Adviser will need to discuss with you the programme of work you have arranged and offer advice where possible. This discussion will need to be fairly detailed but it is not intended to be intimidating in any way. Please note that <strong>we have a duty </strong>to ask that evidence be produced to ensure that the provision is suitable.</p>
<p>You should note that the visiting Adviser will not be able to direct the learning which takes place, nor accept any responsibility if you decide to educate your child at home. It is your responsibility to plan your child's education and to carry it out. The LA cannot provide books or other resources, which may be recommended, although we will try to be as constructive as we can.</p>
<p>If your child is already being educated at home and the family moves to Tameside: Write to the LA and let us know each child's name, date of birth and previous as well as current address, telling us that you are educating at home. The LA will send an acknowledgement to you and you will be asked to submit a proposal form as above.</p>
<h3><a name="11"></a>What kind of evidence will be helpful?</h3>
<p>A written programme of work will be a good starting point for discussion. Samples of work also give a good indication of progress over time, as well as current abilities.</p>
<h3><a name="12"></a>What if I don't inform the LA, just keep my child at home?</h3>
<p>Under Section 7 of the Education Act 1996, Tameside LA must satisfy itself that parents are fulfilling their duties. If you do not provide evidence of this either in writing or by discussions with an Adviser, the LA may conclude that your child's education is not effective and we would then take steps to get your child back in to school.</p>
<h3><a name="13"></a>How often will the LA check?</h3>
<p>We hope to establish a good working relationship soon after we receive the proposal form and an early visit by an Adviser can be arranged. Our aim is to have 2 visits in the first year (about 6 months apart) and annually after that. However, if any doubts are expressed at any stage, the programme may need more frequent review. An Education Welfare Officer&nbsp;will also visit, to check that work is progressing as planned.</p>
<h3><a name="14"></a>What happens if the LA is not satisfied?</h3>
<p>You will be kept fully in the picture if we are not satisfied and advised by letter which issues are unsatisfactory. We will give you a reasonable time to improve the situation and then a further visit will be arranged.</p>
<p>If we are still not satisfied, the LA may make an Attendance Order (Section 7 of the Education Act 1996), requiring you child to attend a named school. Failure to comply with such an Order would be an offence.</p>
<p>We would stress, however, that this will only happen if we are convinced that you are not educating your child according to his/her age, ability and aptitude. We hope that by detailed discussion, we will be able to show you why this is so. It is rare for this to happen.</p>
<h3><a name="15"></a>Child Protection</h3>
<p>The welfare and protection of all children are of paramount concern and the responsibility of the whole community. As with school-educated children, child protection issues may arise in relation to home-educated children. If any child protection concerns come to light in the course of engagement with children and families, or otherwise, these concerns should immediately be referred to the appropriate authorities using established procedures.</p>
<h3><a name="16"></a>Finally, Points to Consider Carefully</h3>
<ul class="square">
    <li title="*">think long a hard about your decision to home educate. It is a major step which will commit you considerably, as far as time and energy are concerned;</li>
    <li title="*">look at the costs involved - visits? books? resources?</li>
    <li title="*">plan what you intend to do with your child before making a decision;</li>
    <li title="*">consider the social side of growing up; the need to provide opportunities for your child to be involved in social activities, contact with other children, joint activities with other children and groups, and the stimulus of seeing other children's work. The benefits from such activities may provide a source of motivation for your child to succeed;</li>
    <li title="*">keep your options open as your child's needs may change at different ages and stages. We will always be willing to work with you to find a suitable place for your child in a Tameside school;</li>
    <li title="*">it would not be in your child's best interests if you decide to home educate because of a disagreement with a teacher or a school. Talk out the problem, or refer it to the Governors of the school; or to the LA for help in getting it resolved;</li>
    <li title="*">home education should not be seen as a solution to the problem of getting a reluctant child to school. Your childs school will be able to offer support or referral to another agency for help with this.</li>
    <li title="*">in order to prepare your child for adult life it is recommended that a programme of study is planned that will lead to a recognised qualification in English, Maths and other subjects that will contribute to a broad education. Your child may be&nbsp; disadvantaged if she/he does not have GCSE qualifications or equivalent at age 16. <strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="17"></a>Support and Resources</h3>
<p>As already stated, when parents elect to home educate their child they assume financial responsibility for their child's education. There are a number of sources of advice and practical assistance to such parents.</p>
