        <!-- #BeginEditable "content" --> 
      <p>The Council, as the Local Authority (LA) ensures the provision of nursery education within a range of schools. This can be English medium, Welsh medium or an Aided or Controlled school. Nursery provision is offered on the basis of five 2 Â½ hour sessions per week during the school year 2016/2017. The sessions which your child will be able to attend will be made known to you by the headteacher as soon as possible after you have been notified about a nursery school place for your child.</p>
      <!--<p>The <a href="nurserypolicye.htm">Nursery Admissions Policy</a> allows parents to express a preference for a place at any school with nursery provision. The Admitting Authority will consider parental preferences when allocating places. Parents are advised, however, that should there be more preferences expressed than there are places available at the school, then places will be allocated in the following priority order:</p>
      <ul>
    <li>The LA will consider the needs of children in public care (looked after children); </li>
     <li>the LA will consider the additional learning needs of children; other special circumstances of the child, including medical reasons; </li>
     <li>the LA will allow younger brothers or sisters (siblings) to be admitted to that school at which the older child is registered for the year of admission; </li>
     <li>the LA will take full account of the proximity of the childâs home to the school for which a preference has been expressed. The LA will ensure as far as possible that a place will be offered at the child's nearest suitable school within the County Borough. In implementing this criterion, account will also be taken of transport arrangements and any potentially hazardous route between home and school</li>
  </ul>-->
      <p>Copies  of the County Borough's <a href="education_docs.htm">&quot;Parents' Guide to Education Services in Wrexham&quot;</a> are available for  reference purposes at the Authorityâs offices, schools and at public libraries  or click on the link to view this document. If you wish to visit a school prior  to expressing your preference, you should arrange an appointment with the  headteacher. You will then be able to express your preference on the basis of  the information contained in these documents and on the basis of any visit(s)  you have made to the school(s).</p>
      <p>The law does not allow you to choose a school for your child, merely to state preferences to attend particular schools. Parents should state multiple preferences for Wrexham schools in case their application for one or more of their requested schools is unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>From 4 January 2016 you can apply  on-line for a nursery school place for your child, using the On-line Admissions  Service at https://admissions.wrexham.gov.uk.Â  All you  need is your email address in order to make an on-line application from your  home computer. </p>
      <p>By producing a library card you  can also use the facilities at Contact Wrexham and Wrexham Library to make your  on-line application .Â  If you prefer to  complete a paper application form this can be downloaded by clicking on the  link below.</p>
      <p><strong>The closing date for applications is 26 February 2016. </strong></p>
	    <p class="start"><a href="https://admissions.wrexham.gov.uk">Online Admissions Service</a></p>
      <p>Late applications will be dealt  with after those that have been received on time, it is therefore very  important for you to meet the deadline referred to above.</p>
      <p>The Admitting Authority can only  admit a certain number of pupils to each nursery class and will only admit  pupils up to the admission number, this number is shown in the school list in  the Parents' Guide to Education Services in Wrexham. </p>
      <p>If there are more applications  made than there are places available at your preferred school, the Admission  Authority will apply their over-subscription criteria as published in the  County Borough's <a href="http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/education/education_docs.htm">Parents'  Guide to Education Services in Wrexham</a>. <strong>Parents are reminded that if their child is currently in Early  Education Entitlement, there is no guarantee of a place in the nursery at that  school as a separate formal application needs to be made.</strong></p>
      <p>If you have expressed a  preference for a community, nursery, primary, or a controlled school, your  application will be considered by the LA. Alternatively, if you have expressed  a preference for a Catholic or Church in Wales Aided school, your application  will be considered by the governing body of that school.</p>
      <p>It will take some time for the  allocation process to be completed but you will be informed by <strong>13 May  2016 </strong>whether or not your child has been allocated a nursery place at  your preferred school.</p>
      <p>If the LA, or in the case of the voluntary aided sector the governing body of the school are  unable to comply with your preference and are unable to allocate a place for  your child at your preferred school, there is no formal right to appeal.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, issues relating to a child&rsquo;s &lsquo;home address&rsquo; are brought to the LA&rsquo;s attention  after school places have been allocated.Â   In such cases, the LA is obliged to carry out further investigations  concerning a child&rsquo;s &lsquo;home address&rsquo; and in doing so, may ask parents/carers to  provide official documentation as evidence confirming a child&rsquo;s &lsquo;home address&rsquo;.Â  Parents/carers are  advised that a child&rsquo;s school place may be lawfully withdrawn if the  information given on their application is subsequently found to be fraudulent  or misleading.Â  The consequence of this  could be that there may no longer be a place available for the child at their  next nearest school.Â  <strong>If two parents cannot agree which  school/schools they prefer, they must seek independent legal advice, and if  necessary an appropriate court order, before submitting a single application to  the LA. </strong></p>
      <p>If you feel that there are  special circumstances you wish to bring to the Authority&rsquo;s attention, please  note them on your application. If your child has a disability, which could  affect his/her progress and participation in school life, please note this on your  application and provide any supporting evidence, for example a letter from a  registered health professional such as a doctor or social worker.</p>
      <p>If your child has a Statement of  Special Educational Needs, the LA will try its best to allow your preference of  nursery school but it has to make sure that the school can meet your child&rsquo;s  needs fully. After your application has been received, a Local Authority  Officer will write to you and may wish to arrange a meeting to discuss your  child&rsquo;s nursery education.</p>
      <p>If your child has an older  brother or sister currently registered at your preferred school, who will still  be registered at the time the younger one is due to start, please note this on your  application, giving the elder brother or sister&rsquo;s name and date of birth.</p>
      <p><strong>You are reminded that  transport is not provided for children of nursery school age except in  exceptional circumstances. Please note, also, that admission to a nursery class  at a particular school does not guarantee a place for your child in the reception  class at that school, as a separate formal application needs to be made.</strong></p>
