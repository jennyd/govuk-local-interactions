is entitled to school transport?
<p>You need to have your child enrolled at school before we can arrange transport for 
you but we can advise before enrolment as to whether you would qualify for transport help from a particular 
address. All homes have a school designated to them for transport assistance. To be eligible for free 
School Transport a pupil must attend the designated school appropriate for his/her age and the home 
address, and must be over the statutory distance. This is a national standard and is two miles for pupils 
under 8 years and three miles from age eight. The distance is measured along the &#8216;shortest available 
walking route&#8217;. If you are unsure which school is designated to your address for transport entitlement 
(which can be different to the school&#8217;s own admission criteria) or whether you are over 2 or 3 miles, 
please contact the Education Transport Unit.</p>
<a name="eligibility002"></a>We are on a low household income; do we qualify for any additional 
help?
<p>If you are entitled to free school meals, or the maximum level of Working Tax Credit, 
further eligibility criteria applies:</p>
<p>Primary School Children:</p>
<ul><li>the walking distance for qualification is reduced to 2 miles.</li></ul><p>Secondary 
School children: </p>
<ul><li>The walking distance for qualification is reduced to 2 miles and</li>
<li>Transport may be given to any one of the three nearest secondary schools to the child&#8217;s 
home providing that the school is over 2 miles and no more than 6 miles away.</li></ul><a name="eligibility003"></a>My 
child has special needs, do the same distances apply?
<p>If your child has a statement of special needs that specifies transport, please 
refer to SEN Transport. Children with special needs but without a specific statement 
are assessed for eligibility to free transport in the standard way. (please see &#8220;<a href="schoolseducationandlearning/schoolsandcolleges/schoolstransport/transporttoprimaryandsecondaryschools/transporttoprimaryandsecondaryschoolsfaqs.htm#eligibility001">who is 
entitled to free transport</a>&#8221;)</p>
<a name="elligibility004"></a>We live below the required distance but there are special circumstances?
<p>If a pupil is not entitled to free school transport under the standard criteria 
and the parent or carer feels that there are exceptional education, medical or social grounds which 
may affect how we consider an application for free transport, please complete an application form and 
attach a letter explaining the special circumstances. These will be considered confidentially.</p>
<a name="eligibility005"></a>My child is attending a faith preference school, what help with transport 
can I get?
<p>From September 2012, free transport to a faith school can be provided in cases where 
all the following are met;</p><ul><li>The child attends secondary school.</li><li>The 
parent(s) of the child attends church weekly.</li><li>The church attended is the same religious 
denomination as that of the school attended.</li><li>The school is between 2 and 15 miles 
from home</li><li>The child receives Free School Meals (FSM) or the parent receives the maximum 
level of Working Tax Credit for their case.</li></ul><p>Any other assistance the 
council provided previously for transport to faith schools is no longer available. Parents should contact 
their child&#8217;s school to enquire about what arrangements the school might be able to offer.</p><a name="eigibility006"></a>My 
son/daughter will be attending a &#8216;taster day&#8217; at his/her new school. Is transport provided?
<p>Unfortunately, there is no entitlement to school transport for pupils attending 
&#8216;taster&#8217; days at schools and you will need to make your own arrangements for them to get there by fare-paying 
bus/lift/walking or cycling.</p>
<a name="eligibility007"></a>We are moving house, will my child still be entitled to free school 
transport?
<p>The eligibility will need to be re-assessed from your new address. Please contact 
the Education Transport Team on 01225 713398 with your new details.</p>
<a name="eligibility008"></a>The route my child has to take to school is too dangerous to walk
<p>The measured route must be one along which a child, accompanied as necessary, can 
walk with reasonable safety to school. If the route (or part of the route) is considered by you to be 
unsafe, the Council will assess it using the guidelines on safety we use for the whole county. If part 
of the route is assessed as unsafe, an alternative shortest route is looked for and, if it is over the 
statutory distance, free transport will be given. Please write to the Education Transport team giving 
details of the part of the route needing assessment.</p>
<a name="eligibility009"></a>Is my child really expected to walk 3 miles (2 miles if under 8) 
to school each day?
<p>This is a national standard used to measure entitlement to free school transport. 
The distance is measured along the shortest available walking route between the child&#8217;s home and school. 
Parents can be confused by this and believe that we expect their child to walk to school, but it is 
just termed a walking route because in some areas part of the measurement may be along paths and not 
roads. Nobody expects children to walk but it is for parents to take responsibility for getting their 
child to and from school if they live under the statutory distance.</p>
<a name="eligibility010"></a>Can I get a petrol allowance?
<p>A petrol allowance can be considered only if there is no suitable bus/train/taxi 
running in the area; or where parental transport would be more appropriate for the pupil, or where it 
is economically viable for the Council to do so, due to exceptional circumstances. Please complete an 
application form and enclose a letter stating your request and we will let you know whether this can 
be authorised.</p>
<a name="eligibility011"></a>Our local school is full, how do I get transport for an out-of-area 
school?
<p>If you have been refused a place at the designated school to your home address, 
transport to the next nearest school can only be considered if you have appealed against the decision. 
If a place at the designated school is still refused, after appeal, then transport can be considered 
to the next nearest school (by distance) from your home address if it fits the distance or route safety 
criteria. If applying to the next nearest school, please enclose a copy of the appeal refusal letter 
with your application. However, you need to have applied on time in the admissions process to be considered 
for transport to anywhere else. If you moved house and had to apply late for transport, please supply 
proof of your house move date.</p>
<a name="eligibility012"></a>My child will be attending a work experience placement; will they 
be entitled to free transport?
<p>Unfortunately, there is no entitlement to school transport for pupils attending 
work experience placements and you will need to make your own arrangements for them to get there by 
fare-paying bus/lift/walking or cycling.</p>
<a name="Transport_to_primary_and_secondary_schools_FAQ-Anchor-37"></a>How do I appeal an entitlement decision?
<p>If you are unhappy about a decision which has been made regarding transport entitlement 
for your child, you can pursue your request further.</p>
<p>If there are individual circumstances that you did not include with your original 
application and that you want to be considered, these should be submitted in writing to the Education 
Transport Entitlement Manager. Your transport request will then be reviewed in the light of the new 
information submitted.</p>
<p>If your application is again refused and you wish to appeal against the decision, 
you can request for your case to be heard by an Appeals Panel. </p>
<p>The Appeals Panel comprises 3 elected members of the Council who have undergone 
appropriate training. The Panel will consider the reason(s) for the refusal, hear your case and arrive 
at a decision which will be communicated to you within 3 days of the hearing. You will have the opportunity 
of attending the Appeals Panel to put your case forward. You can ask for your case to be considered 
by the Appeals Panel by completing the form. For further details on this appeals procedure and to request 
a form, please contact Democratic Services on 01225 718024.</p>
<p>Please note that it will take approximately five weeks from your appeal being received 
to the appeal decision being made.</p>

it and post it to us.</p>
<a name="applyingfortransport002"></a>After I have applied for transport what happens next?
<p>Once your transport entitlement has been assessed, you will receive a letter from 
the Education Transport Team, notifying you of the decision.</p>
<a name="applyingfortransport003"></a>How long does it take to process an application form?
<p>If you are requiring transport to start in the autumn term, please return your completed 
form to the Transport Unit by 1 June for students in years 0 - 11 and before 30 June for students over

<a name="pplyingfortransport004"></a>Do I have to re-apply each year?
<p>You don&#8217;t need to re-apply unless you change address or your child changes school 
(including moving to senior school) or goes into sixth form or college.</p>
<a name="applyingfortransport005"></a>If information I provide on the travel application form changes, 
who needs to know?
<p>Please contact the Education Transport team on 01225 713396/8 if you have a change 
of details such as changing address or changing school/college part-way through your Primary or Secondary 
or Further Education. The Entitlement Team will have to re-assess your application and they will write 
to you as soon as possible after you have informed them of this. For changing school or college at the 
usual ages of 5, 11 or 16 you need to complete a transport application form which you can obtain from 
the Customer Care Unit. Please note &#8211; even if you stay at the same school at the age of 16, you need 
to apply to the Post-16 Transport Scheme at that time because you aren&#8217;t in compulsory education any 
more.</p>
<a name="Transport_to_primary_and_secondary_schools_FAQ-Anchor-38"></a>Spare Seats
We're not entitled to free school transport - can I pay for a seat on the school bus?
<p>Where there are spare seats available on vehicles contracted to the Council they 
may be allocated, at a charge, to students not entitled to free school transport. The offer of a Spare 
Seat place is made on the understanding that payment must be made in advance and that any seat allocated 
will have to be relinquished if:</p>
<ul><li>The seat is required for an entitled pupil, or one with a higher priority 
</li>
<li>The Service is withdrawn when the transport requirements in the area are reviewed.</li></ul><p>Please 
note that a &quot;spare seat&quot; allocation may be removed at very short notice.</p>
<p>Spare seats cannot be offered on vehicles where fares can be paid.</p>
What are the charges for a spare seat?
<p>This is dependent on age of pupil and distance as follows:</p>
<p>(2010/11 academic year)</p>
<table><tr><td>School</td><td>Distance frome home to school</td><td>Charge per term (based on a 3 term year)</td></tr><tr><td>Primary</td><td>less than 3 miles</td><td>&#163;73</td></tr><tr><td>Primary</td><td>3 miles or more</td><td>&#163;95</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary</td><td>less than 3 miles</td><td>&#163;86</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary</td><td>3 miles or more</td><td>&#163;108</td></tr><tr><td>Post-16 (sixth form/college)</td><td>less than 3 miles</td><td>&#163;110</td></tr><tr><td>Post 16 (sixth form/college)</td><td>3 miles or more</td><td>&#163;176</td></tr></table>How

<p>While we expect all our school/college buses to run on time, unexpected delays and

bus stop until 30 minutes after the bus is due, then ring the Council&#8217;s Education Transport Hotline 
on 01225 713365. We will then contact the company for you and arrange alternative transport if necessary.</p>
<a name="transportarrangements002"></a>How do I find out the times of a School or College bus?
<p>Information on school and college buses in Wiltshire can be obtained by ringing 
the Council&#8217;s Education Transport Hotline on 01225 713365.</p>
<p>Students who are being issued with a bus pass by the Council should also find this 
information included on the backing card onto which the pass is attached. Please remember that students 
should always be at the bus stop 5 minutes before their bus is due</p>
<a name="transportarrangements003"></a>Can friends or parents travel on a school bus?
<p>In order to avoid the risk of overloading, school buses can normally only be used 
by children or students who have been issued with a bus pass for that route by Wiltshire Council. However, 
there are a few exceptions so to check if this rule applies on your route, please ring the Council&#8217;s 
Education Transport Hotline on<i> </i>01225 713365.</p>
<a name="transportarrangements004"></a>My child wants to travel on a different school bus or get on at a 
different stop - is this possible?
<p>Students are only able to travel on the bus for which their pass has been issued. 
If there is more than one bus serving your area, it may be possible for you to change buses if there 
is space available - please ring the Council&#8217;s Education Transport Hotline on 01225 713365 to find out 
if this is possible. Please also ring this number if you wish to change your pick up point.</p>
<a name="transportarrangements005"></a>What if my child needs to stay behind after school?
<p>We regret that it is not possible to provide extra transport for those students 
who choose to stay behind for extra-curricular activities. However, occasionally, we may be able to 
arrange for your bus pass to be accepted on an ordinary bus service if one is available at no extra 
cost - please ring the Council&#8217;s Education Transport Hotline on 01225 713365 if you need this facility.</p>
<a name="transportarrangements006"></a>My child has left something on their school bus - how do I get it 
back?
<p>Please ring the bus company direct on the telephone number shown on the backing 
card which the bus pass was attached to. If you cannot find this, please ring the Council&#8217;s Education 
Transport Hotline on 01225 713365 and we will do our best to help (please note that it may take a few 
days for your property to be recovered and that you may have to go to the company&#8217;s office to collect 
it. A small administration fee may also be charged by the bus company).</p>
<a name="transportarrangements007"></a>What happens if there is bad weather?
<p>Please listen to your local radio station to see if your school is closed or if 
the bus has been cancelled. If there is no announcement, go to your pick up point for the normal time 
but wrap up warm as the bus may get delayed en route. If the bus has not arrived 30 minutes after it 
is due, please ring the Council&#8217;s Education Transport Hotline on 01225 713365 for advice. In bad weather, 
it may be necessary for the bus company to cancel the morning school journey at short notice if they 
do not believe that they can reach the school safely.</p>
