<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>It is the responsibility of the parents/ carers to apply for a school place.</li>
<li>You can apply for up to three schools, putting the school you want the most as your first preference. We strongly advise you to use all three preferences.</li>
<li>We advise you to enter your catchment area school as one of your preferences so that there is more chance of your child being offered a place at one of your chosen schools.</li>
<li>If you live in Wiltshire and want to apply for a school place outside the county, you must still make your application to Wiltshire Council. We will pass on your application details to the relevant council where it will be considered alongside the other applications for that school.</li>
<li>If you do not live in Wiltshire and want to apply for a Wiltshire school, you must make an application to your own local authority. They will then pass on your application details to us. You will not be able to use the Wiltshire online application system or Wiltshire's paper application form. The only exception to this would be <a href="schoolseducationandlearning/schoolsandcolleges/schooladmissions/changingyourchildssschool.htm#Changing_your_child's_school-service_personnel">applications from children of UK service personnel.</a></li>
<li>We will acknowledge receipt of your application. If you do not receive acknowledgement within 15 school days of returning your completed application, please contact Customer Services at Wiltshire Council on 01225 713010.</li>
<li>All online applicants will receive immediate email confirmation of registration and once the application has been submitted a separate comfirmation email will be sent.</li></ul>
