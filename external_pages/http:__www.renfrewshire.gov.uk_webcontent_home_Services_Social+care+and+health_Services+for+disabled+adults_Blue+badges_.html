<h3>About the Blue Badge Scheme</h3>

<p>The Blue Badge Scheme is an important service for people with severe mobility problems. It allows badge holders to park close to where they need to go. Renfrewshire Council issues Blue Badges to people living in Renfrewshire who qualify for the scheme.</p>

<p>You don't need to own a car or be able to drive one. The badge is personal to you. You can use it in any vehicle that you are travelling in as a driver or a passenger within Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 June 2013, those who previously applied for DLA (Disability Living Allowance) will now be eligible to apply for PIP (Personal Independence Payment). For those in receipt of PIP, the passport to a Blue Badge will automatically be available to:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Those who receive the mobility component of PIP awarded at 12 points for planning and following journeys which includes those who cannot follow the route of a familiar journey without another person, assistance dog or orientation aid.</li>

<li>Those who receive the mobility component of PIP awarded at 8 points or more for moving around.  </li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="Who" name="Who"> </a>Who can have a Blue Badge?</h3>

<p>Some people qualify for a Blue Badge automatically without having an assessment. Others may also qualify, but need to have an assessment first to see whether their mobility impairment is severe enough. This is to make sure that only people who need a badge get one.</p>

<p><a target="" title="Back to top of page" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="Dont" name="Dont"> </a>People who don't need to have an assessment</h3>

<p>You may be be issued with a badge without further assessment if you are over two years old and fall within one of more of these criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>You receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance</li>

<li>You receive the Mobility Component of Personal Independence Payment at either the standard or enhanced rate</li>

<li>You are <a target="" title="Blind people" href="#Blind%20people">registered as blind</a> (severely sight impaired)</li>

<li>You receive a War Pensioner's Mobility Supplement</li>

<li>You have been both awarded a lump sum benefit at tariffs 1-8 of the Armed Forces and Reserved Forces (Compensation) Scheme and are certified as having a permanent and substantial disability which causes you to be unable to walk or have very considerable difficulty in walking.</li>

<h3><a id="Do" name="Do"> </a>People who need to have an assessment</h3>

<p>If you don't automatically qualify, you may still do so if you meet one or more of these criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are over the age of two and have a permanent and substantial disability which means you are unable to walk.</li>

<li>You are over the age of two and have a permanent and substantial disability which means you are virtually unable to walk.</li>

<li>You are over the age of two and have a temporary and substantial disability, for more than 12 months but less than 3 years, which means you are unable to walk.</li>

<li>You are over the age of two and have a temporary and substantial disability, for more than 12 months but less than 3 years, which means you are virtually unable to walk.</li>

<li>You drive a vehicle regularly and have a severe disability in both arms which means you are unable to operate all or some types of parking meters.</li>

<li>You drive a vehicle regularly and have a severe disability in both arms which means you have considerable difficulty operating all or some types of parking meters.</li>

<li>You are under the age of three and have a medical condition that means you must always be accompanied by bulky medical equipment.</li>

<li>You are under the age of three and have a medical condition that means you must always be kept near a vehicle in case you need emergency medical treatment.</li>
</ol>

<p>If none of the above apply, you are unlikely to be eligible to receive a Blue Badge because the information you have provided indicate that you are unlikely to meet the qualifying criteria.</p>

<p>If you meet criteria 1, 2, 3 or 4 above, you will need to arrange a mobility assessment from a council occupational therapist to check if you qualify for a Blue Badge. Please call our Customer Contact Centre on <strong>0300 300 0300 </strong>to arrange an assessment.</p>

<p>If you meet criteria 5 or 6, please visit the Customer Service Centre or a Customer Service Point with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>proof of identity</li>

<li>proof of residency</li>

<li>Blue Badge fee, and</li>

<li>a letter from a consultant confirming that you have a severe disability in both arms and are either unable to operate all or some types of parking meter, or have considerable difficulty operating all or some types of parking meter.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you meet criteria 7 or 8, please visit the Customer Service Centre or a Customer Service Point with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>proof of identity</li>

<li>proof of residency</li>

<li>Blue Badge fee, and</li>

<li>a letter from a consultant confirming you are under the age of age three and have a medical condition that means either that you must always be accompanied by bulky medical equipment or always be kept near a vehicle in case you need emergency medical treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p><a target="" title="" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="Success" name="Success"> </a>What happens once my application is successful?</h3>

<p>When you have been approved for a Blue Badge and the required evidence and fee have been provided, we will request your Blue Badge.</p>

<p>It will be issued from a national distribution centre and will be delivered to your home address along with an information booklet and parking clock for use if travelling in England and Wales.</p>

<p>It may take up to 10 working days from the approval date for your badge to arrive.</p>

<p><a target="" title="Back to top of page" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="Lost" name="Lost"> </a>Lost, stolen or damaged badges</h3>

<p>All lost or stolen Blue Badges must be reported to the police.</p>

<p>For lost Blue Badges, you need to provide a lost property slip, which will be provided by the police. For stolen Blue Badges, you must provide a crime reference number.</p>

<p>The £20 administration charge must also be paid for replacement badges. When a replacement is requested, the lost/stolen badge will be cancelled. Any subsequent use of the old badge, should it turn up, would be a criminal offence subject to a maximum £1,000 fine.</p>

<p>If your Blue Badge becomes damaged, bring the damaged badge and £20 administration fee to the Customer Service Centre or Customer Service Point and a replacement will be requested.</p>

<p><a target="" title="Back to top of page" href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3><a id="Renew" name="Renew"> </a>Renewing your Blue Badge</h3>

<p>Renewal applications are processed in the same way as new applications.</p>

<p>As Blue Badges are produced at a national distribution centre and posted to you, we recommend you reapply for your Blue Badge around six weeks prior to the expiry date of your current badge.</p>

<p><a target="" title="Back to top of page" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><a id="Organisations" name="Organisations"> </a>Blue Badges for organisations</p>

<p>Organisations may be eligible for Blue Badges if they provide care and transportation for disabled Renfrewshire residents who meet at least one these criteria:</p>

<p>Are over the age of two and:</p>

<ul>
<li>registered as blind (severely sight impaired)</li>

<li>receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance</li>

<li>receive the Mobility Component of Personal Independence Payment</li>

<li>receive a War Pensioner's Mobility Supplement</li>

<li>receive a tariff within 1-8 (inclusive) of the Armed Forces and Reserved Forces (Compensation) Scheme and have been assessed as having a permanent and substantial disability which causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking.</li>

<li>have a permanent and substantial disability which means they are unable to walk</li>

<li>have a permanent and substantial disability which means they are virtually unable to walk</li>

<li>have a temporary and substantial disability, for more than 12 months but less than 3 years, which means they are unable to walk</li>

<li>have a temporary and substantial disability, for more than 12 months but less than 3 years, which means they are virtually unable to walk</li>

<li>drive a vehicle regularly and have a severe disability in both arms which means they are unable to operate all or some types of parking meters, or</li>

<li>drive a vehicle regularly and have a severe disability in both arms which means they have considerable difficulty operating all or some types of parking meters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the age of three and:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a medical condition that means they must always be accompanied by bulky medical equipment, or</li>

<li>have a medical condition that means they must always be kept near a vehicle in case they need emergency medical treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, organisations should have a clear need for an organisational Blue Badge rather than using the individual Blue Badges of the people being transported.</p>

<p>Blue Badges must only be used for the purpose of transporting people who meet one or more of the criteria above. If employees of the organisation use the badge to take advantage of the concessions when there are no passengers in the vehicle who are themselves eligible for a badge, they could face a fine of up to £1,000.</p>

<p>To apply, please bring the Blue Badge application form (completed by a senior member of the organisation) and an organisation stamp or letter-headed paper to the Customer Service Centre or Customer Service Point.</p>
