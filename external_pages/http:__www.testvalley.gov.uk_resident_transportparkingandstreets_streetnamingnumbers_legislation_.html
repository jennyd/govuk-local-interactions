        <p>Street naming and numbering is a statutory Council function. The relevant powers for local authorities are contained in Sections 64 and 65 of the Towns Improvement Clauses Act 1847, and Sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Public Health Act of 1925. Both of these acts are still in force even though they exceed 150 years and 75 years respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These Acts require the local authority to prepare street naming and numbering schemes and to maintain a good standard of street nameplates. Both are essential for the efficient functioning of postal and emergency services as well as for the convenience and safety of the general public.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Public Health Act 1925, Section 19 gives authorities the power to insist that the name of every street shall be shown in a conspicuous position and, also alter or renew it if it becomes for any reason illegible. This section also makes it illegal to pull down or remove a street name, which has been lawfully set up, or to fix a notice or advertisement within close proximity to the sign. Anyone found guilty of infringing these requirements can be liable to a fine imposed by a Magistrates Court</p>
<p></p>
<p>These acts also give the Council the ability to produce regulations concerning the erection of signs for the names of public streets and, ensure that the names and numbers of all buildings are displayed by their owners in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Street naming and numbering is an important aspect of modern life that is often taken for granted, but it is sufficiently important to need legislation to enforce the requirements of government and local government in this area.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All address data is compiled in the Council&rsquo;s Local Land and Property Gazetteer (LLPG) and provided regularly to the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG), both continually maintained and updated in accordance with the requirements of BS7666.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Further information on the NLPG can be found by visiting <a href="http://www.nlpg.org.uk/">http://www.nlpg.org.uk/</a></p>

<p></p>
<h3>1. Naming and Numbering of New Streets</h3>
<p>Commonly developers familiar with the Council&rsquo;s Street Naming and Numbering procedures will usually apply for a numbering and naming scheme at an early stage of the development. The Council will request that the developer provide a plan showing all proposed names for all new streets and, will at this stage also consult the local Parish Council, enquiring whether they have any particular preference for a historical or local street name.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Council charges an administration fee for the creation or registering of all new properties and is based on the size of the proposed development and not on the number of new street being created. The fees charged are on a sliding scale as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Development of a single dwelling - &pound;106<br />
Development of between 2 and 20 new dwellings - &pound;211<br />
Development of more than 21 Dwellings - &pound;10 / New Dwelling</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once these proposed street names have been supplied to the Council, the Street Naming and Numbering Officer and the Royal Mail/ Post office will carry out a check to ensure that no conflict occurs with any other street names, within the local area.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In cases where the Council and / or Royal Mail consider that the a proposed street name is unsuitable, commonly due to conflict with an existing local street name, the developer will be requested to supply, to the Council, an alternative name for the new street. The Council and the Royal Mail / Post office will then repeat the process of checking this alternative street name for conflict with any other street within the local area, with this procedure continuing until a acceptable name is proposed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given that no conflict occurs the proposed street names will be then be submitted to the local Ward Councillor for their approval and agreement. The Council will not propose a name to the local Ward Councillor unless it is considered acceptable to the Street Naming and Numbering Officer and the Royal Mail / Post Office.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: Agreement by the local Ward Councillor is required within 14 days of the request for approval by the Street Naming and Numbering Officer, should no approval be received within 14 days then the proposed street names will be assumed to be approved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Should the local Ward Councillor not approve or accept the name proposed by the developer then they will be requested to propose an alternative name and the process will recommence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: Notice of the request for an alternative street name will be served by the Council within 27 days of the receipt of the original street name proposal, by the Street Naming and Numbering Officer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Should the developer wish to appeal against this decision, the appeal is required to be made to the local magistrate court within 21 days of the Council&rsquo;s rejection decision. The local magistrate court will then rule on the proposed name of the street, and either the developer will be requested to provide an alternative name for all streets, or the proposed street name will be approved by the court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following approval by the local Ward Councillor and agreement with the developer for the proposed street naming and numbering, Royal Mail / Post Office will be requested to allocate postcodes for all the properties along the street.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: Royal Mail / Post office will not issue a postcode until informed officially by the Street naming and Numbering Officer that an address has been allocated, and the address is not complete without the correct postcode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the street name has been agreed a layout plan and street naming and numbering schedule is prepared by the Council, allocating a number and street name to all the developer&rsquo;s plot numbers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: Purchasers of new properties should take care when passing on their new address details, to ensure that they are using the correct postal number and not the plot number, as the two are not necessarily the same.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>2. Naming and Numbering of the Development of Individual New Properties</h3>
<p>The development of Individual properties is most commonly carried out on infill land, large gardens, or on the site of previously demolished properties. These types of developments will, where possible, be numbered within the existing naming and numbering sequence and, letter suffixes (e.g. 16A) will be used if required. Where a development takes place on the site of a demolished property, the new building will inherit the demolished property&rsquo;s number, where one was originally allocated, however a new name for a property maybe added should it be required.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Council charges an administration fee for the creation or registering of all new properties and in the case of a single new dwelling the fee is &pound;106.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where a newly developed property requires a name the developer will be requested to propose one, where there is an existing number at the site the Council will inform the developer that this must remain but that a name may be added. In situations where there is a consistent street numbering sequence the Council will require, where possible, the new property to follow this sequence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Street Naming and Numbering Officer will on receipt of a proposed name or number carry out a check to ensure that this proposal does not conflict with any other name or number in the same locality. On passing the Council&rsquo;s conflict check the proposed name or number will be submitted to Royal Mail / Post office to carry out a further conflict check to satisfy their postal delivery requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Should conflict be found by the Council&rsquo;s Street Naming and Numbering Officer or Royal Mail / Post office, the Council will inform the developer in writing and request an alternative name or number proposal to be submitted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: Notice of a request for an alternative name for a development should be served by the Council within 27 days of receipt of the original naming proposal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the Council Street Naming and Numbering Officer receives agreement for the proposed address from the Royal Mail / Post Office, the Council will inform the developer in writing that the name or number has been agreed, and will inform all other address parties including Royal Mail / Post Office, Valuation Office, Weymouth Land Registry, Emergency Services, Council Tax and Electoral Registration offices.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>3. Naming and Numbering of the Development of Multiple New Properties where no new street names are created</h3>
<p>These types of developments are carried out in a similar manner to those of individual properties, on vacant or infill land, or on the sites of previously demolished properties. In these cases a number of new properties or flats are being developed on a piece of land, but there is no requirement for a new street to be created.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Council&rsquo;s procedure for the naming and numbering of multiple properties within a development follows the same rules as those for individual properties, however the fees charged by the Council for the registering or creation of new dwellings uses a sliding scale depending on the size of the development. For between 2 and 20 new dwellings the fee is &pound;211, whilst for more than 21 new dwellings the fee is &pound;10 per new dwelling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once this procedure has been completed the Council&rsquo;s Street naming and Numbering Officer will issue the developer with a plan and schedule indicating the new names and / or number for each individual plot that is being developed.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>4. Renaming &amp; Renumbering of streets</h3>
<p>Under Section 18 of the Public Health Act 1925 the Council can alter the name and numbers of any street if there is a particular need to do so. Should you wish to change the name of your street or consider that the street has been named in error, or has sections that need renaming, you should contact your Parish Council, who will need to agree a new scheme of naming with all the residents, along the street. The Parish Council will then make an application to the Council for a street name change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Council makes a charge for the renaming of a street of &pound;400 plus advertising and legal costs, to be paid in advance and which is non-refundable. No charge is made if the requirement for the renaming of a street has been requested by the Emergency Services due to confusion or problems in locating a particular street.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A request to change, alter or correct the name of a street can be made directly to the Council&rsquo;s Street Naming and Numbering Officer, who will conduct a consultation exercise with all residents living along the street to be changed, to obtain their views as this change. The change of name of a street will only proceed should a clear majority of the residents are in agreement with the proposed change. If a clear majority are not in favour of the change then the Street Naming and Numbering officer will write to the original correspondent and all residents that no change will take place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On receipt of a request to change a street name the Council will give careful consideration to the proposal along with consulting with the Royal Mail. On acceptance of the new street name, the Street Naming and Numbering Officer will request approval for this change from the local Ward Councillor. Once approval has been gained the Council&rsquo;s Legal and Democratic Service will prepare Street Renaming Notices to be displayed in conspicuous positions at both ends of the street to be renamed, 32 days prior to the Street Renaming Order coming into effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All objections to this proposed change of street name will be required to be notified to the local magistrates court within 21 days of the erection of the Street renaming Notices, where objections will be heard and the granted or rejected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Should all no objections be supplied or all objections rejected the Street Renaming Order will come into effect on the date indicated on the Street Renaming Notices. The Street Naming and Numbering Officer will confirm in writing to all residents living along the street, and the Parish Council the new street name, for their information.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>5. Renaming / Changing / Addition / Removal of House Names and number</h3>
<p>Where a property has been allocated a house number, neither the property owner nor the Council may remove that number from the property or substitute the number with a name, and the number must be displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where only a number has been allocated to a property the owner of that property may add a name to the property; and both the name and number for the property must be displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Where a property has both a name and a number, despite recognising the name and number the Royal Mail will only display the number within their database. The newly added name is considered to be an &ldquo;Alias&rdquo; within the address and, Royal Mail do not require both name and number to deliver items of mail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where both a name and a number have been allocated to a property the owner may remove the name, but the allocated number must remain and, be displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a property owner to change, add or remove a name to their property or, add a name to an already numbered property, the Council requires that the owner of the property contacts the Street Naming and Numbering Officer in writing, confirming the existing name of the property along with its proposed name. The Council charges an administration fee of &pound;79 for the services for the changing adding or removing of a name to a property, the fee being payable by cheque to TestValleyBorough Council. All correspondence should be made to the following address:</p>

<h3>6. Postcodes</h3>
<p>Test Valley Borough Council is not responsible for issuing new postcodes. This is the responsibility of Royal Mail. However they will not issue a postcode for a new street or property until requested to do so by the Council.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Postcodes for commercial premises are allocated in the same way as residential premises, but a large company or business can apply to Royal Mail for its own code &ndash; known as a large user code. Application for a large user code is the responsibility of the user, as they will know what volume of mail they generate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inquiries about postcodes can be dealt with direct at:</p>
<p>Phone: 08456 045060</p>
<p>Fax: 08456 054433</p>

<p></p>
<p>Searches for postcodes can also be carried out on the Royal Mail Website: <a title="Royal Mail" href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm">www.royalmail.com/portal/rm</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<h3>7. Street Nameplates</h3>
<p>When a road is built as part of a new development it is the responsibility of the developer to arrange for the installation of a street nameplate to the appropriate specification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For advice location and specifications of the correct new street nameplates, please contact the Council&rsquo;s Planning Policy and Transport Engineering Team at <a href="mailto:engineers@testvalley.gov.uk">engineers@testvalley.gov.uk</a> or call 01264 368000.<br />
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the street has been adopted under a Section 38 Agreement the Council will take over responsibility for maintaining all nameplates.</p>
