<div id="article" role="article">
		<p>If you or someone living in your property is permanently disabled you may qualify 
for a disabled facilities grant towards the cost of providing adaptations and facilities to enable the 
disabled person to continue to live there. Such grants are given by the council under Part I of the 
Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and are means tested except in the case of adaptations 
for children. If you are interested in adaptations for a disabled child then please also refer to 
the <a href="counciltaxhousingandbenefits/housing/hsgprivatehomeownerstenants/haggrantsloansprivatesectorhousing/hsgchildrenwithdisabilities.htm">children with disabilities</a> information.</p><p>There 
are strict eligibility criteria for disabled facilities 
grants.</p><ul><li>Mandatory grants  - include access into and around the property and the main rooms used by the disabled person, safety 
of the disabled person and adapting the heating and lighting controls.</li><li>Discretionary 
grants - In certain circumstances this provides a top up if the grant exceeds &#163;30,000. Please email 
<a href="mailto:housingrenewal@wiltshire.gov.uk">housingrenewal@wiltshire.gov.uk</a> if you require further information about this.</li></ul><h3>Applying 
for the grant</h3><p><img class="right" src="housingdisabledgrantschairlift.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Stairlift at bottom of stairs" border="0" /></p><p>Before making 
an application your occupational therapist will make an assessment of your needs and    confirm that the proposed works are necessary and appropriate. For some medical conditions the occupational 
therapist will need to seek advice from the disabled person&#8217;s consultant.</p><p>You 
can receive help to make the application and throughout the whole process (including drawing plans, 
applying for building regulations and sending the work schedule and plans to tender etc)  from the local home improvement agency.   If you are a council tenant then this help will be provided by your landlord. Some housing associations 
may provide a similar service. Your occupational therapist can advise you about this.</p><p>You 
can also apply for a grant if you wish to arrange the work yourself; however, if you are considering 
applying for a grant, you should contact the Private Sector Housing Team before you start any work. 
You will not be awarded a grant for any works completed before you receive approval from the council.</p><p>The 
council's private sector housing team will need to determine that the proposed works are both reasonable 
and practicable, 
depending on the age and condition of the property. We will need to look at the most cost effective 
way of meeting the needs of the disabled person. We may recommend an alternative to the proposed scheme 
such as using existing rooms e.g. use of a dining room as a bedroom. This should be done in consultation 
with your occupational therapist, who will be advising on functional needs, to ensure that any alternatives 
being considered are appropriate for your specific assessed needs, taking into account present and future 
predicted needs in relation to your disability/condition.</p><p>The disabled person 
or their agent will need to prepare a schedule of works and plans. These will be agreed in advance with 
us and enable the work to be tendered. We 
will be able to advise on the number of quotes that are required for any application.  </p><p>The grant will only be paid when we are satisfied that the work 
has been completed to our satisfaction and in accordance with detailed specifications laid down in 
the schedule of works, and with the grant approval. Please note, that you are responsible for 
ensuring that your builder meets the standard you require. A grant can only be paid on provision of 
an acceptable invoice, demand or receipt of payment for the works. An invoice is not acceptable if it 
is for work or services provided by the applicant or a member of his or her family. Where the works 
are carried out by the applicant or a relative, only invoices for materials or services that are bought 
in may be considered.</p><p>We may pay the grant in full when the works are complete 
or by instalments as the works progress. We will normally pay the grant directly 
to your contractor. This should not affect your right to ensure that the contractor has completed the 
works to your satisfaction. If the contractor has not, you should notify us so that we can 
withhold payment, if appropriate.</p><p>When making an application you must be sure 
that you intend to remain in the property for the foreseeable future. You will be asked to sign a certificate 
stating the intention to remain in the property for the next five years.</p><h3>Role of 
the Occupational Therapist (OT)</h3><h3><img class="left" src="housingdisabledgrantsshower.jpg" width="244" height="244" alt="Shower fitted with disabled facilities" border="0" /></h3><p>The 
role of the OT is to carry out an assessment based on functional need, taking into consideration the 
disabled person&#8217;s medical condition in order to identify any needs and possible solutions. If, as a 
result of this assessment, housing adaptations are needed then one option might be to advise you of 
the disabled facilities grant as a solution.  Another may be to give advice on the possibility of moving to a more suitable property, which is either 
already adapted or more suitable to be adapted.</p><p>If the OT feels that the works 
are both &#8216;necessary and appropriate&#8217;, they can support you in making an application and liaise with 
the home improvement agency or appropriate agent as well as provide any necessary paperwork or information.</p><p>They 
would provide advice about the adaptations that are required and comment on proposed plans. They will 
also attend any case conferences and panels to explain how your needs are met by the proposal.</p><p>The 
OT is not responsible for the grant, and does not have the skills or specific knowledge to mediate on 
technical points about the structure or build process.</p><h3>The role of the private sector 
housing team</h3><p>We administer the grant application and are responsible for making 
the decision about approving the grant and making payments. We will also make the financial assessment 
which will confirm the amount of grant that is eligible and whether any contribution should be made 
by the disabled person.</p><p>We need to make sure that all options 
have been considered at an early stage. We will liaise with the occupational therapist to conclude 
which options are necessary and appropriate to meet the needs of the disabled person.  </p><p>We will also consider whether the work is reasonable and practicable. This 
means whether it is reasonable and practicable to carry out the works having regard 
to the age and condition of the building. We take into account the condition 
of the house and whether it is safe to live in.  We also have to consider if the dwelling is suitable for adaptation due to its design, any planning 
constraints and the affect of any adaptations on other occupiers.</p><p>Where the 
options are unusual or complex a case conference involving other professionals will be arranged. This 
is to make sure 
that the options are considered from several view points and the decision reached is justified and consistent 
in relation to the regulations that govern the terms of a disabled facilities grant.</p><p>Before 
approving an application the private sector housing team will need to be sure that the proposal is the 
most cost effective option for meeting the disabled person&#8217;s needs and that the application is properly 
made.</p><h3>The home improvement agency</h3><p>Most people want to stay 
in their own homes as they get older or if they are disabled. With the right practical advice 
and support, they can.  </p><p>Our local home improvement agencies can help with advice on benefits and other 
sources of funding where 
the work isn&#8217;t covered by the disabled facilities grant.  They will write the specification for the work, organise the tenders and supervise the work.</p><p>Home 
improvement agencies have a wealth of experience in managing both the grant application and the 
design and build process. You are free to choose an alternative but we advise that you discuss 
options and preferences with the private sector housing team and your occupational therapist before 
making a start.</p><h3>Fees, costs and charges</h3><p>To help get the 
work carried out, other costs and charges are likely to be incurred e.g. architects fees, planning permission, 
building regulations, agency fees. You need to clarify with your agent what the costs are and if you 
can offset them against the grant; you also need to understand any liability you may incur.</p><h3>Grant 
conditions</h3><p>Conditions will be applied to any grant awarded and it is important 
that you read and understand these.</p><h3>Land charges</h3><p>It 
is a condition of the grant that a local land charge will be made in the case of owner occupied application 
where the grant exceeds &#163;6,000. This allows the recovery of funds in the event of a property subsequently 
being sold or otherwise disposed of. The land charge will be made for the amount that exceeds &#163;5,000, 
for examples in the case of a grant for &#163;6,000 a &#163;1,000 land charge will be taken up to the maximum 
allowed (at this point &#163;10,000)</p><h3>Land charges - exceptional circumstances</h3><p>When 
a property is disposed of, repayment of the land charge may be exempt in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>If 
a client moves to another property within the ten year period that does not require adaptations to be 
carried out; the new property is more appropriate to their needs (as confirmed by an occupational therapist) 
repayment  will be waived.</li><li>If the client is moving into an enhanced or extra care accommodation.</li><li>If 
the client's death results in a child inheriting the whole of the property whose financial position 
is such that they could not raise a mortgage or a loan to repay the charge. This is intended to be a 
safeguard for children who have a mental impairment or who have acted as a carer for their parent.</li></ul><h3>Standard 
of service</h3><p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7821/138595.pdf" target="_blank">Delivering Housing Adaptations for Disabled People, 
A Good Practice 
Guide</a>, sets out the service disabled people should reasonably expect to receive including recommended 
target times for delivery.</p><p>Please

(HIA) acting as agent.</p><h3>Time line for disabled facilities grants</h3><p>Please
