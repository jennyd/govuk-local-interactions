<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>It is the responsiblity of the parents/ carers to apply for a school place.</li>
<li>You can apply for up to three schools, putting the school you want the most as your first 
preference. We strongly advise you to use all three preferences.</li>
<li>We advise you to name your catchment area school as one of your preferences so that there 
is more chance of your child being offered a place at one of your preferred schools.</li>
<li>Some primary schools in Wiltshire operate as a single school but have two geographical 
bases. These are known as split site schools. For admission purposes, these sites are treated as separate 
schools therefore on your application you should name the school site which you are applying for. If 
you would like to apply for both school sites, you must name each school site as a preference.</li>
<li>If you live in Wiltshire and want to apply for a school place outside the county, you 
must still make your application to Wiltshire Council. We will pass on your application details to the 
relevant council where it will be considered alongside the other applications for that school.</li>
<li>If you do not live in Wiltshire and want to apply for a Wiltshire school, you must make 
an application to your own local authority. They will then pass on your application details to us. You 
will not be able to use the Wiltshire online application system or Wiltshire's common paper application 
form. The only exception to this would be <a href="schoolseducationandlearning/schoolsandcolleges/schooladmissions/changingyourchildssschool.htm#Changing_your_child's_school-service_personnel">applications from children of UK Service personnel.</a></li>
<li>We will acknowledge receipt of your application. If you do not receive acknowledgement 
for your paper application within 15 school days of returning it please contact customer services at 
Wiltshire Council on 01225 713010.</li>
<li>All online applicants will receive immediate email confirmation of registration and once 
the application has been submitted a separate confirmation email will be sent.</li></ul>
