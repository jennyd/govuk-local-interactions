<h2>The school transport service we provide</h2><p>We provide free home to school transport for children in Surrey meeting our eligibility criteria.&nbsp;For other children, we may be able to offer alternative help, for example concessionary seats. For students aged 16+ we offer discounted bus and rail travel tickets.</p><h3>Eligibility - Under 16 transport to school</h3><p>Children&nbsp;aged 4 to&nbsp;16 are eligible for free home to school travel support if they live in Surrey and:</p><ul><li>they attend their nearest qualifying school which is more than two miles from their home (for children under 8) or three miles from their home (for children over 8) measured by the shortest walking route (accompanied by an adult as necessary); or</li><li>they are aged between 8 and 11 and are entitled to free school meals, or their families are in receipt of the maximum amount of Working Tax Credit, if they attend their nearest qualifying school and the shortest&nbsp;walking route (accompanied by an adult as necessary) between their home and the&nbsp;school is more than two miles; or</li><li>they are aged 11 and over and are entitled to free school meals or their families receive the maximum Working Tax Credit. These children will qualify for help with travel to one of their three nearest qualifying schools where they live between two miles (measured by the shortest walking route) and six miles (measured by the shortest road route) from the school; or</li><li>they are aged 11 and over and are entitled to free school meals or their families receive the maximum Working Tax Credit and they attend a school based on religion or belief which is more than two miles (measured by the shortest walking route) and not more than 15 miles (measured by the shortest road route) from the home address.</li></ul><p>Eligibility to free transport is not linked to the admission criteria of a school. For example, some junior and secondary&nbsp;schools may give priority for a school place to children who are attending a feeder school but this does not confer an automatic right to free transport.</p><h4>The home to school transport policy</h4><p>Our transport policies for <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/64974/Transport_Policy_4-16_FINAL_2015_V8.pdf">2015/16</a> and <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/64973/Transport_Policy_4-16_FINAL_2016-17_V1.pdf">2016/17</a> explain our eligibility criteria in more detail.</p><h4>Assessing eligibility</h4><p>When assessing applications for free home to school transport for pupils under 16 we also take into account these things:</p><ul><li>If, when you applied for a school place you could have applied for a nearer school which had vacancies, but chose not to, your child would not usually be eligible for free transport.</li><li>If you apply for a school place at a school that is not your nearest, you will be eligible for free transport only if any nearer schools are oversubscribed and you would not have been offered a place. Exceptions may apply when your nearest school is out of county and your child attends their nearest Surrey school.</li><li>If a different school is the nearest school with an available place at the time of allocation, when measuring by straight line distance as opposed to shortest walking route, free transport will be provided to either school as long as the age and distance criteria are met.</li><li>If you are moving into the area, your nearest school will depend on the availability of school places at the time of your application.</li><li>You should be aware that if your child is granted transport to a school further away due to the lack of places at nearer schools, it will not necessarily follow that your younger children will also get transport to attend that school. This is because places may then be available at nearer schools for your younger children.</li><li>If your child is transferring to the junior stage of education, your nearest school with places may not necessarily be a junior school. You should also check any nearer all-through primary schools that normally admit children into year 3.</li><li>When considering nearest schools, schools both inside and outside the county boundary will be taken in to account.</li><li>We will consider the safety of the walking route when assessing transport eligibility.</li></ul><h4>Our home to school transport frequently asked questions</h4><p>These will answer <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/4214/Home-to-School-Transport-Frequently-asked-questions.pdf">commonly asked questions.</a></p><h4>Apply now</h4><p>For children processed in the normal admissions round for entry into <strong>Year 7</strong> our Admissions and Transport team automatically assesses home to school transport for each child after the initial allocation of school places. If your child is entitled you will hear from us by 1 July in the year of admission. You should not complete an application form before that date as this can cause unnecessary delay to the assessment process.</p><p>For all children processed in the normal admissions round for entry into <strong>Year R or Year 3</strong>, where parents believe they meet the eligibility criteria for free transport, an application form will need to be submitted by&nbsp;31 May. The outcome of these applications will be communicated to parents in writing during the first week of July.</p><p>If you wish to apply for free transport based on your eligibility for free school meals or the maximum Working Tax Credit you will have to complete an application. If you are successful you will be required to renew your application every year.</p><p>In order to be considered for home to school transport needed as a result of any school allocation from July onwards and for all in year admissions a parent has to complete an <a href="https://online.surreycc.gov.uk/esuite/esuite.nsf/openOnlineForm?open&amp;fcunid=B020D6376227ADE88025716300580B2D">application form.</a></p><p>If you think your child may be entitled and you haven't heard from us by&nbsp;11 July, please&nbsp;contact us.&nbsp;</p><p>If your child is not eligible for free transport it is your responsibility as a parent to get your child to and from school. You should consider this factor when choosing a school to apply for.</p><p>Our Transport Co-ordination Centre will allocate the type of transport (bus, coach, train, minibus/taxi or petrol allowance).</p><h4>Our concessionary seat scheme</h4><p>Spare seats on contract coaches and taxis are hired out to pupils or students not entitled to a free seat, once all the pupils entitled to a seat have been allocated theirs. They can be withdrawn (and a refund given) if the seat is later needed for a pupil entitled to a free seat. Our <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/58067/Conc-Seat-letter-2015-2016.pdf">application letter (PDF)</a> explains more.</p><p>If your child is not eligible&nbsp;for free transport, you can apply for a concessionary seat&nbsp;by completing an <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/73890/CONC-FORM-v2.pdf">application form (PDF)</a>.

If parents do this, they should:</p><ul><li>take and meet their child from the same side of the road as the bus/coach stops</li><li>inform the escort in the morning, (where there is one) if their child is not returning home on that vehicle.</li></ul><h4>Withdrawing transport because of bad behaviour&nbsp;</h4><p>If your child persistently misbehaves on a school bus we can withdraw the transport we provide. We would also support a headteacher's decision to withdraw transport provision for disciplinary reasons linked to use of that transport. If we ban your child, we will write to tell you. If it is the headteacher's decision, they will advise you how long your child is banned from travelling on the bus for. It will be your responsibility for ensuring your child gets to and from school during that time. At the end of that period there must be assurances of improved behaviour if your child is to be allowed to travel on the vehicle again.</p><p>Email our contact centre contact.centre@surreycc.ov.uk, or call on 0300 200 1004 for advice.</p><h4>Accidents and emergencies&nbsp; - information for parents</h4><p>If there is a minor incident on school transport our Transport Co-ordination centre will be advised. The centre will advise your child's school which will contact you.</p><p>If your child is involved in a major incident your child's school is responsible for:</p><ul><li>contacting you</li><li>making arrangements for children who are brought into school from the incident</li><li>ensuring with us (or any other local education authority involved) and the emergency services that all children on the service are accounted for. Our Contact Centre will also handle calls from parents not able to contact their children's school(s).</li></ul><h4>Escorts &ndash; information for parents</h4><p>On some of the school transport we provide there will be an escort responsible for:</p><ul><li>the safety and care of the children in the vehicle</li><li>ensuring all children delivered to school on the morning journey are accounted for on the homeward journey</li><li>ensuring that only entitled children travel on the vehicle and</li><li>ensuring that in the event of problems during the journey, they stay with the children.</li></ul><p>Escorts are provided for pupils with special educational needs or disability (SEND) where their case officer has identified the need. An escort is also provided with SEND pupils under 5.</p><p>The escorts' wear Transport Co-ordination Centre (TCC) authorised ID badges issued by us.</p><h3>Operational advice</h3><h4>If there is a major incident</h4><p>If there is a major incident different organisations take on the following responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Emergency Services &ndash; are responsible at the scene of the incident for all aspects.</li><li>Our Transport Co-ordination Centre (TCC) - is responsible for liaising with the emergency services and the relevant transport operator so that there is a central source of information about the incident. Operators must complete the TCC accident/incident report form.</li><li>The School - is responsible for contacting parents of children involved in the incident, making arrangements to deal with children brought into school from the incident, ensuring with the Local Education Authority and the emergency services that all children on the service are accounted for.</li><li>Our Contact centre &ndash; is responsible for dealing with telephone enquiries from parents unable to contact the relevant school.</li></ul><h4>Escorts &ndash; information for operators</h4><p>If there is an escort on the school transport you provide, they must first be cleared through the TCC authorised accreditation scheme and must wear their TCC authorised ID badge when carrying out the role.</p><p>We expect escorts to:</p><ul><li>be particularly vigilant when children leave the vehicle</li><li>take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the children when entering or leaving the vehicle. They are not responsible for helping children before they board or after they have left the vehicle. If the vehicle arrives at the school early, children should be kept on the vehicle.</li><li>report all behaviour problems to the headteacher.</li><li>keep the child on the vehicle if they are not met and do not normally make their own way home and call the school/Pupil Services for further instructions, at the end of the route. If the Escort does not contact either, they should take the child to the nearest police station as soon as possible and report the situation.</li></ul><p>Escorts should not:</p><ul><li>leave the vehicle to collect children. The vehicle may wait three minutes only beyond the planned pick-up time.</li><li>allow children to be collected from or set down at unauthorised stops. The route must not be altered without prior permission from our Transport Co-ordination centre. The vehicle must keep to scheduled times. Any vehicles running early must wait until the scheduled time to continue to the next point.</li></ul><h4>Information for transport providers</h4><p>To be eligible to quote for home to school transport contracts, run by the Transport Co-Ordination Centre (TCC), all operators must be registered on the <a href="https://www.sesharedservices.org.uk/esourcing">SE Shared Services e-sourcing portal</a>, and have submitted and passed the Pre Qualification&nbsp;Questionnaire&nbsp;(PQQ).</p><p>The PQQ opens for new applicants on a 3 month rolling window.&nbsp;The PQQ is located in the tender <strong>SCC / ESCC IC Client Transport DPS.</strong></p><p>All driver and escorts, involved in the transportation of children and vulnerable adults, on contracts issued through the TCC need to be accredited through the <strong>TCC Authorised Identity Badge (AIB) scheme. </strong>Only drivers and escorts working for approved TCC operators will be accepted to apply for an AIB.</p><p>Please follow the links to apply for a <a href="https://online.surreycc.gov.uk/esuite/esuite.nsf/openEvents?open&amp;fcunid=7D013509E9F105ED80257B950030D0D3&amp;year=0&amp;month=0">TCC Authorised Identity Badge</a> or to apply for a <a href="https://online.surreycc.gov.uk/esuite/esuite.nsf/openOnlineForm?open&amp;fcunid=041DDFA5E0F374AE80257D4F00466F16&amp;aztitle=TCC+Authorised+Identity+Badge+change+of+operator+or+lost+badge+application+form">change / replacement to a current, valid badge.</a></p><p>Please ensure all applicants are aware of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/documents-the-applicant-must-provide-">approved documents list</a> as issued by the Disclosure &amp; Barring Service.

The list does not include coach and taxi services provided by Surrey County Council, as they are not available to the general public.</p><p>Here are the Contact details for <a href="http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/buses-and-trains/contact-details-for-bus-operators">bus operators in Surrey</a>.</p><h3>Use of minibuses - advice for schools and community groups</h3><h4>Driving licences</h4><p>Managers, headteachers and responsible persons must ensure everyone reporting to them and required to drive, hold a valid driving licence, and that this is checked every six months and a record of the audit kept. Visit GOV.UK for minibus and trailer licensing regulations for UK nationals.</p><p>For EU residents, holders of valid licences issued by EU member states may drive in the UK until aged 70 or for 3 years after becoming resident whichever is the longer. Holders of Community licences with vocational entitlement (Categories C and D) must register their details with DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency).</p><p>Non-EU staff must have licences valid in their 'home' country and can drive in the UK for 12 months only. After then, to continue driving, they must take a UK Statutory Driving Test (within the 12 months) after first applying for a Provisional Licence. You should encourage drivers to exchange their licence for a UK licence as soon as possible as it is often difficult to interpret the classifications of licences from non-EU Countries. Staff in this category may only drive vehicles with eight seats or less.</p><p>All non-UK staff should receive additional vocational training to ensure that they are sufficiently skilled and experienced to drive in the UK.</p><h4>Minibus driver assessment training</h4><p>When we insure a minibus, all drivers of it must have had their driving skills formally assessed within the past four years. The national recognised driving standard is the Minibus Driver Awareness Scheme (MiDAS); after successfully completing it, a driver receives a certificate valid for four years. Several organisations provide this training. For advice contact:</p><ul><li>Andy Taylor, Waverley Hoppa Community Transport by email: enquiries@hoppa.org.uk or by phoning 01428 681701</li><li>East Surrey Rural Transport. Email rtp@tandridge.gov.uk or call 01883 732760</li></ul><h4>Insurance</h4><p>Always check the following with your insurer - that:</p><ul><li>your organisation is listed on the Surrey County Council policy</li><li>the policy is current and has not lapsed</li><li>new replacements for older vehicles (now disposed of), have been registered</li><li>any minibus hire includes insurance &ndash; or if not you have made your own insurance arrangements</li><li>your driver(s) hold the right licence(s) to drive the vehicle(s)</li><li>your driver has enough experience to drive a particular vehicle</li><li>you know what limitations on the insurance there are if your driver(s) has penalty points.</li></ul><h4>Permits and vehicle excise licence</h4><p>A vehicle must display a valid vehicle excise licence at all times.<br />For each minibus being used a section 19 minibus permit is required. Each one allows the legal operation of a minibus with more than eight passenger seats on a not-for-profit organisation.</p><h4>Minibus maintenance</h4><p>Pre-use: Before the minibus is used each day, it should be inspected to make sure all the obvious safety-critical items are in satisfactory and working order. A report book should record each inspection. Any repairs should be done before the vehicle is used.<br />Nil-defect reporting: there must be a system in place allowing drivers to formally report in writing any defect occurring with the vehicle on each journey. There must also be a system to ensure that these reports can be acted on.<br />Vehicle maintenance: your minibus must be regularly inspected and maintained by professional vehicle technicians. A planned maintenance schedule should be drawn up with a contractor.</p><p>GOV.UK has useful advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency">maintaining vehicle roadworthiness</a>.</p><h4>Minibus road speed limiter fitment</h4><p>Minibuses with more than eight seats will soon have to be fitted with speed limiters, which will restrict the vehicle's road speed to a maximum of 62 mph (100kph), although lower speed limits must still be adhered to. Contact your vehicle dealer for advice .To find your nearest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-approved-speed-limiter-centre">approved speed limiter centre on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
