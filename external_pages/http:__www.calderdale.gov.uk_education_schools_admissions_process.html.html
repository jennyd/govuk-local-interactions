Many schools have more applications than there are places available. When a school is oversubscribed, places are allocated using the admissions / oversubscriptions criteria. There are common <a href="/education/schools/admission-criteria/index.html">Admission criteria</a> for a number of schools within Calderdale. Calderdale Council will then determine which school should be allocated:</p><ul><li>where a child is eligible for a place at only one of the preferred schools, that school will be allocated to the child;</li><li>where a child is eligible for a place at more than one of the preferred schools, they will be allocated a place at whichever of these is the higher ranked preference on their application form;</li><li>where a child is resident in Calderdale and is not eligible for a place at any of the preferred schools, they will be allocated a place at the nearest school with vacancies, within Calderdale. For Primary schools only, this will be within a two mile walking route wherever possible. For Secondary schools only, this will be within a three mile walking route wherever possible.</li></ul><h3>Co-ordinated admissions scheme</h3><p>Every local authority is required to operate a co-ordinated admissions scheme for children starting primary school, or transferring from primary to secondary school:</p><ul><li><a class="pdfdownload" href="/education/schools/admissions/coordinated-admissions-scheme-primary-2015.pdf" title="Opens in new window">Coordinated admissions scheme for primary schools 2015 [PDF file 243KB]</a><span class="hide">|</span><a href="/siteinfo/help/viewing-pdf.html"><img alt="PDF file" class="linkicon" src="/images/icon-pdf.gif" title="See viewing PDF files" /></a></li><li><a class="pdfdownload" href="/education/schools/admissions/coordinated-admissions-scheme-secondary-2015.pdf" title="Opens in new window">Coordinated admissions scheme for secondary schools 2015 [PDF file 160KB]</a><span class="hide">|</span><a href="/siteinfo/help/viewing-pdf.html"><img alt="PDF file" class="linkicon" src="/images/icon-pdf.gif" title="See viewing PDF files" /></a></li><li><a class="pdfdownload" href="/education/schools/admissions/coordinated-admissions-scheme-primary-2016.pdf" title="Opens in new window">Coordinated admissions scheme for primary schools 2016 [PDF file 249KB]</a><span class="hide">|</span><a href="/siteinfo/help/viewing-pdf.html"><img alt="PDF file" class="linkicon" src="/images/icon-pdf.gif" title="See viewing PDF files" /></a></li><li><a class="pdfdownload" href="/education/schools/admissions/coordinated-admissions-scheme-secondary-2016.pdf" title="Opens in new window">Coordinated admissions scheme for secondary schools 2016 [PDF file 160KB]</a><span class="hide">|</span><a href="/siteinfo/help/viewing-pdf.html"><img alt="PDF file" class="linkicon" src="/images/icon-pdf.gif" title="See viewing PDF files" /></a></li></ul><p>In accordance with the requirements of the School Admissions Code, the Council is required to submit an annual report to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator on aspects of the admission arrangements of the relevant schools in its area.</p><ul><li><a class="pdfdownload" href="/education/schools/admissions/schools-adjudicator-report.pdf" title="Opens in new window">Report to Schools Adjudicator - June 2015 [PDF file 224KB]</a><span class="hide">|</span><a href="/siteinfo/help/viewing-pdf.html"><img alt="PDF file" class="linkicon" src="/images/icon-pdf.gif" title="See viewing PDF files" /></a></li></ul><h2>What happens next</h2><p>An allocation of a Primary or Secondary school place will be confirmed in writing to parents / guardians on National Offer day.

The offer notification will contain the following:</p><ul><li>the name of the school at which a place is offered and the deadline for accepting the place.

Once you have submitted your application, you will receive an email confirming your preferences. You can view and/or amend the online application anytime during the period. If you amend your application, please ensure that you 'resubmit' it. If you have resubmitted your application, you will receive a further email detailing your revised preferences. Your latest application will be used when allocating school places.</p></div><!--for primary schools, hide from this question down to the end of this section and show the hidden section below it--><!--<h3 class="resultsnavbar">When completing the online application, what order should I state the schools?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>All preferences are considered equally, so you should preference the schools in the order that you would like them allocated. The Authority will offer the highest preference possible, if your child is eligible for more than one school. To clarify, your true first preference of school should be put first on the application you submit. This includes the grammar schools.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">Are places offered on a "first come first served" basis?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>No. All applications received during the application period (20 November 2015 to 15 January 2016 for primary schools and 19 June 2015 to 31 October 2015 for secondary schools) are 'on time' and are considered together. Late applications made after 15 January 2016 for primary schools and 31 October 2015 for secondary schools will be dealt with once all 'on time' applications have been considered.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">Do I need to complete any supplementary forms for Calderdale Schools?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>For primary schools, if you are applying for a faith (church) school amongst your preferences, you may need to complete the school's Supplementary information form if you are applying under faith criteria. See the <a sys_folderid="46298" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentid="33467" sys_relationshipid="437114" rxinlineslot="103" sys_contentid="33467" href="http://gorple:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&#38;sys_siteid=305&#38;sys_authtype=0&#38;sys_contentid=33467&#38;sys_variantid=458&#38;sys_folderid=46298&#38;sys_context=0" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="458" title="" sys_variantid="458">primary schools admissions criteria</a> for each school for more details.</p>

<p>For secondary schools, if you are applying for Trinity Academy under the faith criteria, Rastrick High School under the music criteria, or The Brooksbank School under the sports criteria, you will need to fill in the school's Supplementary information form. See the <a sys_folderid="46300" unselectable="on" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentid="33598" sys_relationshipid="437104" rxinlineslot="105" href="http://gorple:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&#38;sys_siteid=305&#38;sys_authtype=0&#38;sys_contentid=33598&#38;sys_variantid=458&#38;sys_command=edit&#38;sys_folderid=46300&#38;sys_context=0" inlinetype="rxvariant" rxselectedtext="" contenteditable="false" sys_dependentvariantid="408">Foundation Comprehensive / Academy schools</a> for each school for more details.</p>

<p>If you wish to register your child for the grammar schools admission test, you will need to complete a registration form between 13 April and 10 September 2015 - see <a sys_folderid="46300" unselectable="on" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentid="34749" sys_relationshipid="437100" rxinlineslot="105" href="http://gorple:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&#38;sys_siteid=305&#38;sys_authtype=0&#38;sys_contentid=34749&#38;sys_variantid=458&#38;sys_command=edit&#38;sys_folderid=46300&#38;sys_context=0" inlinetype="rxvariant" rxselectedtext="" contenteditable="false" sys_dependentvariantid="408">Grammar schools</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">What happens if my child does not reach the academic standard for grammar school? What happens to my other preferences?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>The school will notify you of the outcome of the admissions test prior to the closing date for applications to be submitted, which is 31 October 2015. This information should assist you in making a decision as to whether or not to formally apply for one or both grammar schools (up to five preferences can be expressed). If it is border-line as to whether or not your child is ranked highly enough to be allocated a place at one of the grammar schools, you may still choose to preference the school(s). As all preferences are considered equally, your application for alternative schools will not be disadvantaged if you have preferenced a grammar school(s) but a place could not be offered.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">Can I choose any school?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>The word used in law about school admissions is 'preference' not 'choice'. This means that you can state which school you would prefer your child to attend, but there is no guarantee that the application will be successful. You can list any school you wish as a preference.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">When will my child start school?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>Legally children must start school from the beginning of the term following their fifth birthday. In Calderdale, children are able to start school at the beginning of the Autumn term in the academic year in which they turn five. Children born between 1 September 2011 and 31 August 2012 may start school in September 2016.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">Do I need to apply if my child is already in nursery at a school?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>Yes. There is no automatic progression from nursery to reception and you need to apply in the same way as parents whose children are not in a nursery class. Attending a school's nursery class does not give a child priority for admission to the Reception class.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">Do I need to apply if I already have an older child at the school?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>Yes. The application procedure and timetable is the same for all applicants regardless of whether there is an older child or if the application is for an only child.

<h3 class="resultsnavbar">My child is being looked after by a grandparent / relative / childminder / friend. Can I use their address on the application?</h3>

<div class="boxcontainer">
<p>No. The address used for the application must be the child's current permanent residence. Where parental responsibility is held by more than one person and those persons reside in separate properties, the child's ordinary place of residence will be deemed to be that property where the parent receives child benefit. The Local Authority reserves the right to request further evidence of a child's permanent residence if this is deemed necessary. <strong>An offer of a school place may be withdrawn if a false address is given.</strong></p>
</div>--><!--end of primary school section--><!--for secondary schools, hide from this question down to the end of this section and show the hidden section above--><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Can I choose any school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The word used in law about school admissions is 'preference' not 'choice'. This means that you can state which school you would prefer your child to attend, but there is no guarantee that the application will be successful. You can list any school you wish as a preference.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">When will my child start school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Legally children must start school from the beginning of the term following their fifth birthday. In Calderdale, children are able to start school at the beginning of the Autumn term in the academic year in which they turn five. Children born between 1 September 2011 and 31 August 2012 may start school in September 2016.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Do I need to apply if my child is already in nursery at a school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Yes. There is no automatic progression from nursery to reception and you need to apply in the same way as parents whose children are not in a nursery class. Attending a school's nursery class does not give a child priority for admission to the Reception class.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Do I need to apply if I already have an older child at the school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Yes. The application procedure and timetable is the same for all applicants regardless of whether there is an older child or if the application is for an only child. If there is a sibling already attending the preferred school you need to make sure that you state this in the relevant section of the online application.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">My child is being looked after by a grandparent / relative / childminder / friend. Can I use their address on the application?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>No. The address used for the application must be the child's current permanent residence. Where parental responsibility is held by more than one person and those persons reside in separate properties, the child's ordinary place of residence will be deemed to be that property where the parent receives child benefit. The Local Authority reserves the right to request further evidence of a child's permanent residence if this is deemed necessary. <strong>An offer of a school place may be withdrawn if a false address is given.</strong></p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Are places offered on a "first come first served" basis?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>No. All applications received during the application period (20 November 2015 to 15 January 2016 for primary schools and 19 June 2015 to 31 October 2015 for secondary schools) are 'on time' and are considered together. Late applications made after 15 January 2016 for primary schools and 31 October 2015 for secondary schools will be dealt with once all 'on time' applications have been considered.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">I have heard if I only put one preference on the application I stand a better change of being offered that school. Is that true?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>No. The risk a parent takes by putting only one preference on the application is that if the school preferenced cannot be offered, there are no alternative preferences for us to consider.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">If I list a school as my first preference do I have a better chance of receiving an offer than someone who lists it as a lower preference?</h3><p>No. All preferences are considered equally and you will not be given any extra priority for your first preference. A parent listing a school as a fifth preference, for example, and who could not be offered one of their first four preferences, may be offered a place because they live closer than a parent who had listed the same school as first preference.</p><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Do I need to complete any supplementary forms for Calderdale Schools?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>For primary schools, if you are applying for a faith (church) school amongst your preferences, you may need to complete the school's Supplementary information form if you are applying under faith criteria. See the <a href="/education/schools/admission-criteria/primary-schools/index.html" title="">primary schools admissions criteria</a> for each school for more details.</p><p>For secondary schools, if you are applying for Trinity Academy under the faith criteria, Rastrick High School under the music criteria, or The Brooksbank School under the sports criteria, you will need to fill in the school's Supplementary information form. See the <a href="/education/schools/admission-criteria/secondary-schools/foundation-comprehensive.html">Foundation Comprehensive / Academy schools</a> for each school for more details.</p><p>If you wish to register your child for the grammar schools admission test, you will need to complete a registration form between 13 April and 10 September 2015 - see <a href="/education/schools/admission-criteria/secondary-schools/grammar.html">Grammar schools</a>.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">I have already submitted the application for my child to start in Reception in September 2016 and now I want to change my preferences, what should I do?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>You can log onto your account and change your preferences on your online application until the closing date of 15 January 2016. Please contact the <a href="/education/schools/admissions/contacts.html" title="">Admissions Team</a> for more details.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">What happens if my child does not reach the academic standard for grammar school? What happens to my other preferences?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The school will notify you of the outcome of the admissions test prior to the closing date for applications to be submitted, which is 31 October 2015. This information should assist you in making a decision as to whether or not to formally apply for one or both grammar schools (up to five preferences can be expressed). If it is border-line as to whether or not your child is ranked highly enough to be allocated a place at one of the grammar schools, you may still choose to preference the school(s). As all preferences are considered equally, your application for alternative schools will not be disadvantaged if you have preferenced a grammar school(s) but a place could not be offered.</p></div><p><!--end of secondary school section--></p><h3 class="resultsnavbar">How are primary school allocations made?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Once all the on time applications have been received, the admissions authority for the school will consider all the preferences for that school and, if there are more applications than there are places available, the <a href="/education/schools/admission-criteria/primary-schools/index.html" title="">admissions oversubscription criteria</a> will be applied.</p><p>In the case of Calderdale community schools, the Authority will apply the over-subscription criteria to determine the priority order in which the applicants should be placed.</p><p>In the case of Calderdale's voluntary or foundation schools or academies, the governors of the school will use evidence provided on their supplementary forms, if they have one, to rank the applicants in terms of their oversubscription criteria.</p><p>In the case of schools in other areas, the admissions authority for the school (either the local authority for community schools, the governors for voluntary aided schools or the academy trust for academies) will make admission decisions.</p><p>Once all of the applications have been put in ranked order, these are submitted back to the Admissions Team and places are offered up to the Published Admission Number of the school. Where a child can be offered more than one of the schools they have applied for, the preference order will be used to offer the child the highest preference of the possible offers.</p><p>No child should receive an offer at more than one school.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">What happens if more parents apply for places at a school than there are places available?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>If there are more applications received than there are places available, the oversubscription criteria are applied. The following example may help explain how the procedure works:</p><p>A school can admit 60 pupils, but 80 applications are received. These fall into the following oversubscription categories:</p><ul><li>SEN - 2</li><li>Priority 1 (Children who are Looked After) - 1</li><li>Priority 2 (Siblings) - 20</li><li>Priority 3 (Distance) - 57</li><li>Total - 80</li></ul><p>Therefore all 23 of the SEN, Priority 1 and Priority 2 pupils would be offered places. As the school has 60 places, this leaves 37 places to be offered to pupils in Priority 3. The 37 pupils living nearest the school (measured by a straight line) out of the 57 pupils will be offered places. The 20 pupils falling into Priority 3 living further away from the school would not be offered places, but could request to be placed on the reallocation list, which is ordered in terms of the oversubscription.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">How likely am I to get my first preference school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>It is impossible to know this for sure because the number of parents who apply for each school varies year on year. For children who started primary school in September 2015, 89.9% of parents who applied 'on time' were offered their first preference of school. Another 7.7% were offered one of their other preferences. The number of preferences received for each school and a breakdown of the allocation data can be found on <a href="/education/schools/search.jsp?searchtype=school">Search for schools</a>.</p></div><h3 class="2resultsnavbar">Can I do anything to improve my chances of being offered my preferred school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The most important thing to do is ensure that you apply before the closing date (15 January 2016 for primary schools and 31 October 2015 for secondary schools). The other thing to consider is that if you decide to apply for a school that is not close to your home, then you will be competing for a place with all those applicants who live nearer to that school. This does not mean that you have to apply for your nearest school or that you can be guaranteed a place at your nearest school.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">What happens if the Authority cannot allocate any of my preferred schools?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The Authority has a duty to allocate a school place to all children living within Calderdale. If none of the preferred schools can be allocated, the Authority will allocate the school which is closest to the family home where there are vacancies. This will be within a two mile walking route for primary schools or a three mile walking route for secondary schools wherever possible, and may not be your closest school. For residents outside of Calderdale, your home local authority is responsible for allocating a school place if your Calderdale preferences cannot be met.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">When will I receive my allocation letter?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>National Offer Day is Monday 1 March 2016 for secondary schools and Monday 18 April 2016 for primary schools.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">How will I receive this?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>If you live in Calderdale, the offer of a school place will be made by Calderdale Council, irrespective of where your child attends primary school. You will have the option of how you wish to receive your offer when you apply online. This may be by logging into your online application, by email or by letter.</p><p>If you live outside the Calderdale area, the offer of a school place will be made by your own local authority.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">I have not received my offer, can you tell me which school my child has been allocated?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Allocation of school places will not be confirmed over the telephone. Parents must wait until they receive their email or allocation letter from the Authority, if you are resident in Calderdale, or from your home local authority if resident outside Calderdale.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">I have not been allocated my preferred school - what do I do now?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>With your allocation notification, you will receive further information relating to the reallocation and appeals processes. A reallocation form can be downloaded from <a href="/education/schools/admissions/re-allocations.html">Re-allocations</a>, or from the <a href="/education/schools/admissions/contacts.html" title="">Admissions Team</a>.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Why was my neighbour's child allocated a place at a particular school last year but mine has not this year?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Allocations of places differ year on year. It is possible under the distance category to allocate a place one year, but to be unable to allocate one the following year, even in the same street/area. This is due to the volumes of pupils applying, where they live and whether any higher priority categories have been applied to an application.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">The allocation was based on my old address, but I have since moved. Can this be taken into account?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Yes, reallocation will take into account a change of address. However, if we are not already aware of this change, evidence of the move, such as a utility or council tax bill will be required.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">My application was late, will I be penalised during the reallocation process?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>No, after the initial round, the reallocation requests are considered equally for those that arrive before the close date for re-allocation requests which is Monday 15 March 2016 for secondary schools and Monday 2 May 2016 for primary schools.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">How is priority determined during the reallocation process?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>If any places become available, the oversubscription criteria are reapplied to those seeking reallocation.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">What is the likelihood of my child being reallocated to my preferred school?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The Authority cannot predict this as it depends purely on the number of places that are given up (if any) and who takes priority in terms of the oversubscription criteria.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">If the reallocation request is not successful, when am I likely to get an appeal hearing?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p><a href="/education/schools/admissions/appeals.html">Appeals</a> are normally scheduled to be heard during June of the admissions year for secondary schools and during June and July of the admissions year for primary schools.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">I have decided to send my child to an independent school / teach at home / move area and no longer require the place allocated. What do I need to do?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>Written confirmation will be required to allow us to reallocate the place to another child.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Where can I get advice on how to complete the online application?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The Authority recommends that the parents contact the <a href="/education/schools/admissions/contacts.html" title="">Admissions Team</a> to obtain appropriate advice and guidance. The Authority cannot be responsible for advice taken from any other source.</p></div><h3 class="resultsnavbar">Can I get help with school clothing?</h3><div class="boxcontainer"><p>The governing body of each school is responsible for establishing a dress code for pupils and developing appropriate policies in respect of school uniform. The Authority is not able to assist parents / guardians to purchase items of school uniform or supply school clothing. In exceptional circumstances or dire emergency, parents / guardians should seek advice from the Education Welfare Officer attached to the school.</p></div></div><!--NAV_FOOTER SSI begin- redundant-->
