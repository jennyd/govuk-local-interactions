                                a Non Charitable Housing Association or have been provided accommodation by the armed forces.  You must have spent at least 
                                3 years as a public sector tenant and you will only be able to purchase under the scheme if your house or flat
                                 is your only or principal home and is self-contained.


							</p>
							
							<h3>You may not have the right to buy your home if:-</h3>
							
							<ul>
								<li>
									You have been served with a possession order

								<li>
									If your home is scheduled for demolition and an Initial
									Demolition order has been served.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									If you are an undischarged bankrupt, have a bankruptcy petition pending
									against you or have made arrangements with creditors (people you owe money to) 
									and you still owe them money.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									If you or anyone residing in your home has been served 
									with an injunction order, an Anti Social Behaviour Order (ASBO),
									possession order (for anti social behaviour) or a demotion order 
									is in force or pending against your tenancy.

							<h2><a name="anchor4"></a>How do I know what the value of my home is?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								Once we have determined that you qualify for the Right to Buy, we will arrange for your 
								property to be valued. The valuation is based on the market value of your home as at the 
								date of application minus any improvements you have made to the property at your own expense. 
								The Council will send you an Offer Notice (Section 125) which tells you the price you have to 
								pay and the terms and condition of the sale.  An energy performance certificate will also be provided.
								<br/><br/>
								If you think your landlord has valued your home too high, you have the right under section 128 
								of the Housing Act 1985 to an independent valuation from the District Valuer.  
							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor5"></a>Can I buy my flat/maisonette?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								If you live in a flat or maisonette, you have the right to buy a long lease from your landlord. 
								Individual flats are not usually sold freehold, and therefore you will be required to pay a ground 
								rent of no more than £10 per year. In addition to this you will have to pay service charges,
								this is a charge made to cover communal services such as electricity, cleaning of staircases, 
								repairs and maintenance of the building (e.g. roof repairs, lift maintenance etc.).
								<br/><br/>
								At the time when we inform you of the purchase price, we will also include a schedule of annual 
								charges and any works due to be carried out to your property or the block in which your property
								is situated within the next five years and your likely contribution to the costs involved. 

							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor6"></a>Do I have to pay for a valuation?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								No, the Council will arrange for your home to be valued. However, 
								we do recommend that you obtain an independent survey of your property
								and you may have to pay for a Mortgage valuation and other associated fees.
							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor7"></a>Should I be paying full rent before I can apply to buy my home?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								No, if you are claiming housing benefit you are still entitled to apply to buy your home. 
							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor8"></a>Can I apply to buy my home if I am in arrears with my rent?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								Yes, the application can be processed, but you will be expected to clear any arrears before completion of the sale. 
								However, if you have become subject to a possession order you may not be eligible to purchase your property until the order has been discharged through the Courts.
							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor9"></a>Can I expect to pay less than the market value of my home because I am a tenant?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								Applicants who qualify for the Right to Buy are entitled to a discount on the market value of their home. 
								The amount of discount will depend on the total number of years you have been a secure <strong class="inner">public sector tenant</strong>, 
								this includes previous tenancies, not just the number of years you have lived in your present home. 

                                <ul><li>3 years - 35% discount for a house and 50% discount for a flat</li>
                                <li>4 years - 35% discount for a house and 50% discount for a flat</li>
                                <li>5 years - 35% discount for a house and 50% discount for a flat</li>
                                <li>6 years plus - add 1% per year for houses (up to 70% or the cash maximum - whichever is lower), add 2% per year for flats (up to 70% or the cash maximum - whichever is lower). </li></ul>
                                
                                <strong class="inner">Whatever percentage discount you are eligible to receive, your discount cannot be greater than the cash maximum allowed, which is &pound;77,900 for the Kirklees area.</strong>.

							<h2><a name="anchor10"></a>If I have made improvements to my home will it increase the value of the property?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								When you apply to buy you will be asked what if any improvements you 
								have made to your home. This information will be passed to the Valuer 
								who will assess the value of the property as if the improvements had not taken place. 
							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor11"></a>Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance to my home if I apply to purchase?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								As soon as you apply to buy your home you will not be entitled to routine repairs or improvements 
								(except for work required by law and to keep it weather-tight). Your home will be excluded from
								any planned modernisation works such as new windows etc. 
								<br/><br/>
								If your home is a flat or maisonette it is likely that you will buy your home on a long lease 
								(usually 125 years). Your landlord will be responsible for repairing and maintaining the 
								external and communal areas of the building such as roof and lift areas and for 
								providing buildings insurance cover. However, as an owner of your flat or 
								maisonette you will be required to pay a service charge which will cover a
								reasonable share of the costs incurred by the landlord.

							<h2><a name="anchor12"></a>Can I apply for a mortgage from the council?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								No, Kirklees Council does not offer mortgage facilities
							</p>
							
							<hr/>
							
							<h2><a name="anchor13"></a>How soon after I buy my home can I sell it?</h2> 
							
							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								You are entitled to sell your home straight away. However, if you applied to buy your home on or 
								after 18 January 2005 and you sell or dispose of your property within 5 years of the date of your
								purchase, you will be required to pay back discount.
								<br/><br/>
								If you sell within the first year of ownership the whole of the discount will have to be repaid.  
								Four fifths (80%) of the discount must be repaid if you sell within the second year, three fifths 
								(60%) in the third year, two fifths (40%) within the fourth year and on fifth (20%) in the fifth 
								year. After 5 years you can sell without repaying any discount.  
								<br/><br/>
								<strong class="inner">In addition, the amount of discount to be repaid if you sell within the first 5 years of ownership 
								will be a percentage of the resale value of the property, disregarding the value of any improvements
								you have carried out. </strong> .
								<br/><br/>
							</p>
							
							<p>
								For example, if your home was valued at &pound;100,000 at the time you bought it from your landlord and you received a discount of £20,000, that means that 
								your discount was 20%.
								<br/><br/>
								If your home is valued at &pound;150,000 when you wish to sell it, and you want to sell it within the second year of purchase, 
								you will have to repay &pound;150,000 x 20% discount x 4/5 i.e. &pound;24,000.

							<p>
								If you wish to resell or dispose of your property within ten years, you will be required to offer it to the Council at full market value. The market value must be agreed between the parties or, if they are unable to agree, will be determined by the District Valuer. If your offer has not been accepted within eight weeks, you will be free to sell the property on the open market.

							<div class="topLink">
								<a href="#top">Top</a>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								If the property is sold, the same rules of paying back the discount applies as above. 
								However, family members can take over the ownership of the property without paying back 
								the discount as long as the property is not sold to the family members.
