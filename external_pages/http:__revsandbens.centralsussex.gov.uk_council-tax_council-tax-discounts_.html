					<p>Discounts may be awarded where the number of adults counted as using the property as their main home is less than two.  </p>
<p>When calculating how many people are resident certain people are not counted (disregarded).  If all but one adult is disregarded the discount will be 25%.  If all the residents are disregarded the discount will be 50%.  </p>
<p>If you are the only adult (over 18 years) resident in the property you will qualify for a single person discount. This means a reduction of 25% in your Council Tax.  The remaining 75% payable represents 50% charge for the property and 25% charge for the person resident.</p>
