Help paying your rent &ndash; Housing Benefit                    </h1>
                <div class="editor">
<h2>Universal Credit</h2>
 <p>Please note that if you claim <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a> any help you are eligible for towards your rent costs will have already been paid within your Universal Credit payments. Therefore you do not need to make a separate claim for Local Housing Allowance. </p>
 <h2>Help to pay your rent </h2>
 <p>There are 2 ways that you can get help to pay your rent if you are on a low income. These are: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Housing Benefit - for people that rent from a housing association, rent a caravan or houseboat, or have a tenancy which began before 1989 </li>
  <li><a href="/local-housing-allowance">Housing Benefit (Local Housing Allowance) – for people that are renting from a private landlord </a></li>
 </ul>
 <p><span>You can <a href="/benefits-calculators">use online calculators to work out if you can apply for benefits and how much you might be able to get</a>.</span></p>
 <p><span>Whilst you are receiving Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support you must <a href="/benefit-change-details">tell us about any changes in your circumstances which may affect your claim</a>. </span></p>
 <h2>Housing Benefit </h2>
 <p>Housing Benefit is available if you: </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Pay rent to a housing association or local authority </li>
  <li>Live in a hostel, caravan, mobile home or houseboat </li>
  <li>Pay a rent that has been registered as a 'fair rent' </li>
  <li>Have a tenancy that began before 1989 </li>
  <li>Live in accommodation where a large part of the rent is for board and attendance </li>
 </ul>
 <p>You may be able to claim for Housing Benefit if you: </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Are on a low income </li>
  <li>Are working full or part time and earning a low wage </li>
  <li>Have savings under &pound;16,000 (if you are in receipt of pension credit guarantee this limit does not apply) </li>
  <li>Are receiving state benefits </li>
 </ul>
 <p><span><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/174/application_for_housing_benefit_and_council_tax_support">Apply for Housing Benefit (PDF, 514KB)</a></span>.</span><span class="underline_text"> </span></p>
 <p>Read how we can <a href="/benefit-claim-guide">fast track your benefit application so it is&nbsp;processed within 1 working day</a>.</p>
 <p>If you rent from a private landlord and make a new claim for housing benefit, have a break in your existing housing benefit claim, or move to privately rented accommodation your claim will be assessed under the rules for <a href="/local-housing-allowance">Local Housing Allowance</a>.</p>
 <p><span>Housing Benefit <strong>cannot</strong> normally be paid if you: </span></p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Live with and pay rent to a close relative </li>
  <li>Used to live with your landlord as a member of their family </li>
  <li>Are renting a home that you used to share with your ex-partner </li>
  <li>Are responsible for your landlord’s child </li>
  <li>Used to own the property you now rent </li>
  <li>Live in the home as part of your job </li>
  <li>Live in a care home </li>
  <li>Are a full time student </li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Backdating Housing Benefit</h2><span>
  <p>We cannot usually start your claim before the date that we receive it just because you did not know or did not think you were entitled to benefit. </p>
  <p>If you can show good cause for not making an application earlier we will consider backdating your benefit payments. </p>
  <p>We can only&nbsp;backdate your claim&nbsp;for&nbsp;a maximum period of 6 months for working age customers or 3 months for pensioners.&nbsp; </p>

 <h2>How much Housing Benefit </h2>
 <p>If you (and your partner, if you are a couple) are on a low income, you can get up to the full amount of your rent. However it could be reduced if: </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>You are under pension age, live in a council or housing association home and have one or more 'spare' bedrooms - this is called <a href="https://www.gov.uk/housing-benefit/what-youll-get">under occupancy</a> </li>
  <li>Your rent includes a service charge, such as money for things like heating or meals </li>
  <li>The Rent Officer decides that your rent is above the typical rent for suitably sized accommodation in the area - details about how the Rent Officer makes these decisions can be found on the <a href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/RentOfficers/index.html">Valuation Office Agency </a>website<span class="underline_text"> </span></li>
  <li>You have other adults in your household, for example grown up children, other relatives or friends - these are known as <a href="/benefit-claim-guide#nondependants">non-dependants</a> </li>
  <li>Your income is more than the rules say you need to live on </li>
 </ul>
 <p><span>You can <a href="/benefit-appeals">make an appeal if you disagree with our decision on your Housing Benefit</a>. </span></p>
 <h2>Receiving your Housing Benefit </h2>
 <p>Housing Benefit is usually paid from the Monday following the date your claim is received by our benefits team. </p>
 <p>Housing Benefit payments will be made directly into your bank account. </p>
 <p><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/432/bacs_form_-_tenantpdf">Provide us with your bank details for Housing benefit payments if you are renting a property (PDF, 222KB)</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span><a href="/download/downloads/id/428/bacs_form_-_landlordpdf">Provide us with your bank details for Housing benefit payments if you are the landlord of a property (PDF, 224KB)</a>. </span></p>
 <p><span>If you do not already have a bank account please make arrangements to open one. If you are unable to open a current account due to your credit history you can <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/basic-bank-accounts?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=ps-MM-%20Bank%20accounts&amp;utm_term=basic%20bank%20account&amp;ft_keyword=basic%20bank%20account&amp;ft_section=p%20">open a basic bank account.</a> </span></p>
 <p>We cannot pay into Post Office accounts, and some Building Society accounts do not accept payments – we will contact you to ask for an alternative account if needed. </p>
 <p><span>Alternatively payment will be paid by closed cheque <strong>every 4 weeks</strong> . </span></p>
 <h2>Housing Benefit for 2 properties </h2>
 <p class="textalignleft">Housing Benefit is normally only paid for the rent you pay on one home at a time. There are a few exceptions to this and you may be able to get extra help if: </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li><span>You have moved into other rented accommodation due to <a href="/housing-benefit#violence">fear of violence</a>, you are a <a href="/housing-benefit#student">student or trainee&nbsp;or one&nbsp;of a couple and have to live in separate rented accommodation from your partner </a></span></li>
  <li><span>You have a <a href="/housing-benefit#family">large family</a> and the council has housed you in 2 properties </span></li>
  <li><span>You have <a href="/housing-benefit#move">moved to a new home which you pay rent on and still have to pay rent on your old home</a></span> </li>
 </ul>

 <h2 id="violence">Fear of violence </h2>
 <p class="textalignleft">You may get Housing Benefit if you have left your former home and are staying away because of violence or fear of violence. This can be either in your home by another person, or outside your home by a former member of your family. We always have to consider if it is reasonable to pay Housing Benefit and we may pay for up to 52 weeks. For Housing Benefit to be paid you must intend to return and live in the home you left. </p>
 <p class="textalignleft"><a href="/download/downloads/id/441/payment_on_2_homes_formpdf">Apply for Housing Benefit for 2 properties (PDF, 375KB)</a>. </p>
 <h2 id="student">Students or trainees (c<strong>ouples that live in separate properties) </strong></h2>
 <p class="textalignleft">Couples who are living in separate rented properties may get Housing Benefit for both properties. We must agree that you cannot avoid living in separate accommodation and that it is reasonable to pay benefit on both homes. There is no time limit on these payments. </p>
 <p class="textalignleft"><a href="/download/downloads/id/441/payment_on_2_homes_formpdf">Apply for Housing Benefit for 2 properties (PDF, 375KB)</a>. </p>
 <h2 id="family">Large families </h2>
 <p class="textalignleft">If you have a large family and we have housed you in 2 separate homes because your household is too large to be placed in 1 home, we can pay Housing Benefit for both properties. Both properties must be public housing (whether or not provided directly by the council) and should be next to each other or within a few streets of each other. There is no time limit on these payments. </p>
 <p class="textalignleft"><a href="/download/downloads/id/441/payment_on_2_homes_formpdf">Apply for Housing Benefit for 2 properties (PDF, 375KB)</a>. </p>
 <h2 id="move">New home but still paying rent on old home </h2>
 <p class="textalignleft">If you have moved to a new home, which you rent, and still have to pay rent on your old home you may be able to get some help. The situation has to be unavoidable, for example if you were offered a new home to rent but were unable to give your old landlord the notice they needed. Housing Benefit may be paid for up to 4 weeks on your old home. For this to be considered you must have moved to your new home. </p>
 <p class="textalignleft"><a href="/download/downloads/id/441/payment_on_2_homes_formpdf">Apply for Housing Benefit for 2 properties (PDF, 375KB)</a>. </p>
 <h2 id="empty">If you are not living at your property for a period up to 52 weeks </h2>
 <p>Normally Housing Benefit can only be paid if you are actually living in the property you are claiming benefit for. There are situations where we may still pay Housing Benefit if you are temporarily away from your home. </p>
 <p class="textalignleft">To keep receiving Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support when not living at your property all the following must apply: </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>You must intend to come back to live in the property </li>
  <li>The part of the property you normally live in must not have been re-let or sub-let to someone else </li>
  <li>You must not be likely to be away for more than 13 weeks&nbsp;(52 weeks in special circumstances) </li>
 </ul>
 <p>If you are in hospital as a patient there is no time limit </p>
 <p>Tell us if you want to <a href="/download/downloads/id/442/temporary_absence_formpdf">claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support for a period of temporary absence from your property (PDF, 401KB)</a>. </p>
 <p class="textalignleft">Normally you can only be away for up to 13 weeks and still be able to receive Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support. If it appears from the outset that you are likely to be away longer than 13 weeks we cannot normally pay you any Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support. </p>
 <p>If you are away from home for any of the following reasons, we may be able to pay Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support for up to 52 weeks (as long as at the outset it appears that you will not be away for more than 52 weeks): </p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>A prisoner on remand </li>
  <li>Having medical treatment or medically approved convalescence, but you are not in residential care </li>
  <li>On an approved training course </li>
  <li>Providing medically approved care (must be certified by a medical practitioner eg your doctor or a nurse) </li>
  <li>Caring for a child whose parent or guardian is receiving medical treatment or medically approved care (must be certified by a medical practitioner eg your doctor or a nurse) </li>
  <li>Receiving medically approved care (must be certified by a medical practitioner eg your doctor or a nurse), but you are not in residential care </li>
  <li>Certain students who are entitled to Housing Benefit </li>
  <li>Away due to fear of violence </li>
  <li>Temporary care in residential care, but not if you are living there as a trial </li>
 </ul>
 <p>If there is a change in your circumstances which means that you no longer intend to return to the property you are claiming Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support for, we will no longer be able to pay benefit. This will not affect any benefit paid whilst you still intended to return to the property. </p>
 <p>If the part of the property you normally live in is re-let or sub-let to someone else, we will no longer be able to pay benefit. This will not affect any benefit paid before this happened. </p>
 <p>If it comes to light that you are going to be away for more than 13 or 52 weeks then we will stop paying you Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support, unless you are a patient in hospital. </p>
 <p>If there is any change in your circumstances you must always let us know, so that we pay your benefit correctly. </p>
 <p><span>Whilst you are receiving Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support you must <a href="/benefit-change-details">tell us about any changes in your circumstances which may affect your claim</a>. </span></p>
 <h2>Moving into a care home </h2>
 <p>If you go into residential care for a trial stay (eg to see if it suits you) we can still pay you Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support for up to 13 weeks as long as: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>You still intend to return home if the residential care does not meet your need </li>
  <li><span>Your property is not sub-let or re-let.<strong> </strong></span></li>
 </ul>
 <p>The 13 weeks starts from the date you go into residential care. </p>
 <p>You may receive Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support for up to 52 weeks if you go into residential care (not permanently and not for a trial stay), as long as you still intend to return home and your property is not sub-let or re-let. </p>
 <p>Your total time away, including any time spent staying with a relative immediately before going into residential care, must not be more than 52 weeks. </p>
 <p>Tell us if you want to <a href="/download/downloads/id/442/temporary_absence_formpdf">claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Support for a period of temporary absence from your property (PDF, 401KB)</a>.</p>
 <p><span>If you go into residential care permanently you will no longer be able to claim Housing Benefit and Council Tax Support.<strong> </strong></span></p>
 <p><span>If you return home and live there, and then have to leave again, we will normally start a new period of temporary absence as long as you meet the conditions above. <a href="/download/downloads/id/442/temporary_absence_formpdf">Let us know if you have gone back into residential care (PDF, 401KB)</a>. </span></p>
