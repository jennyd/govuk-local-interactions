officers who can take action if the noise is considered to be a
statutory nuisance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excessive noise can make life a misery, noisy neighbours, noise
from industry or construction sites and&nbsp;barking dogs are just
some of the problems that can be experienced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we have to remember is that no house or flat is totally
sound proof, everybody must expect some noise from their neighbours

time.</p>

<p>There are a number of different sources of noise pollution
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neighbourhood noise (e.g loud music)</li>
<li>Commercial noise (e.g noisy machinery, pubs and clubs)</li>
<li>Aircraft noise</li>
<li>Traffic noise</li>
<li>Barking dogs</li>
<li>Bird Scarers</li>
<li>Fire Works</li>
</ul>

<h3>Neighbourhood noise</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excessive noise from neighbours can be frustrating and can cause
a lot of unnecessary stress and worry.&nbsp; In many cases, the
person making the noise is unaware that they are causing a problem
and therefore the problem can be sorted out quite quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where this approach fails we can serve a notice on the offending
party requiring them to abate the nuisance.&nbsp; If such a notice
is not complied with then legal action can follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="commericalnoise" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<h3>Commercial noise</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noise from commercial premises is often dealt with in the same
way as that from domestic premises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in some cases we may not need to prove a statutory
nuisance where the premises hold a public entertainment
licence.&nbsp; These licences are issued in order to ensure that
the disturbance caused to the general public is kept to a minimum.
Action can be taken against premises that operate outside of its
licensing agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction sites are a very common source of noise
pollution.&nbsp; They are often in areas which were quiet
beforehand and, therefore, the noise generated by their activities
is very noticeable. &nbsp;Construction noise is an anticipated part
of a development and therefore a restriction on working hours is
often prescribed as part of the planning permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="aircraftnoise" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<h3>Aircraft noise</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aircraft noise is excluded from Part III of the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, which means that we have no direct
responsibility in relation to noise from aircraft departing or
landing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="trafficnoise" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<p>Traffic noise is excluded from Part III of the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, which means that we have no direct
responsibility in relation to noise from traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="barkingdogs" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<h3>Barking dogs</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excessive noise from&nbsp;barking dogs&nbsp;can be frustrating
and can cause a lot of unnecessary stress and worry. &nbsp;In many
cases, the person who owns the dog(s) is unaware that they are
causing a problem and therefore the problem can be sorted out quite
quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where this approach fails we can serve a notice on the offending
party requiring them to abate the nuisance.&nbsp; If such a notice
is not complied with then legal action can follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="birdscarers" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<h3>Bird scarers</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bird scarers and bird deterrents are essential to protect many
crops from damage by wild birds.&nbsp; However if used
thoughtlessly they can seriously annoy and disturb the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid causing a nuisance, you should seek to minimise the
impact of auditory scarers on your neighbours and there are steps
you can take to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the scarers as far away from nearby homes as practical,
align them to point away from neighbours and use baffles.</li>
<li>Avoid using auditory scarers within 200 meters of sensitive
buildings before 7am, or before 6am elsewhere when sunrise is
earlier.&nbsp; Use another method in the early morning&nbsp;and do
not use after 10pm when sunset is later.</li>
</ul>
<a name="fireworks" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<h3>Fireworks</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Community Safety &amp; Neighbourhood
Nuisance team can only deal with noise complaints from fireworks if
the fireworks are being set off from a property on a regular
basis.&nbsp; If the fireworks are being set off in the street then
this is a Police matter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are several regulations concerning
fireworks and they are for the</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of fireworks</li>
<li>Storage of fireworks</li>
<li>Sale of fireworks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Fireworks Regulations 2004</strong> prohibit anyone
under 18 from possessing fireworks, and anyone except professionals
from possessing display fireworks.&nbsp; These regulations also
prohibit the use of fireworks at night (11 pm &ndash; 7 am) in England
and Wales, with extensions for the following festivals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until 1 am on the night of Chinese New Year</li>
<li>Until 1 am on the night of Diwali</li>
<li>until 1 am on New Year's Eve</li>
<li>Until midnight on 5th November.</li>
</ul>
<p>These regulations are&nbsp;enforced by the police.&nbsp; Penalty
for breach of curfew is up to &pound;5000 fine or six months
imprisonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005
(MSER) individuals can store up to 5kg of Hazard Type 4 fireworks
(generally Category 1 and 2 fireworks) without a licence and for an
unlimited time.&nbsp; The Regulations also permit individuals to
store up to 50 kg of Hazard Type 4 fireworks for private use for up
to 21 days, without the need to licence or register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, although the Regulations permit small quantities of
fireworks to be kept without the need to licence or register, other
requirements of the regulations - e.g. on storing safely - still
apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further information about all aspects of MSER, including
information about organising a firework display, is available on
the <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" title="Link to HSE Website (External Link)" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/explosives/fireworks/" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}">Health and Safety
Executive (HSE)</a>&nbsp;website.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Sale</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the regulations the sale of fireworks to anyone under 18
is banned, and caps, cracker snaps and party poppers cannot be sold
to anyone under 16. &nbsp;The supply of bangers, mini rockets,
fireworks that fly erratically (squibs, helicopters etc.), ariel
shells, ariel maroons, ariel mortars, some large category 2 and 3
fireworks and all category 4 fireworks are banned from supply to
the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>When is noise nuisance a statutory nuisance?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noise nuisance is covered by Part III of the Environmental
Protection Act 1990. This law empowers local authorities to deal
with noise from fixed premises.&nbsp; Before action can be taken we
have to be sure that the noise constitutes a statutory
nuisance.&nbsp; This means that we have to prove that the noise is
prejudicial to health and/or is causing an unreasonable and
persistent disturbance to your lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Statutory Noise Nuisance is much more than annoyance or the
fact that noise is audible. &nbsp;For a noise to be a Statutory
Noise Nuisance it must be a significant or unreasonable emission of
noise that materially interferes with the use and enjoyment of your
home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several factors determine whether noise is a Statutory Noise
Nuisance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time of day the noise occurs</li>
<li>How loud the noise is</li>
<li>How long the noise lasts</li>
<li>The character of the noise; i.e. bass beat or high pitched</li>
<li>How often the noise occurs</li>
<li>Your location</li>
</ul>
<p>In some case, the noise may be part of another problem such as
anti-social behaviour.&nbsp; If the officer believes the matters of
anti-social behaviour are occurring, then details will be passed to
the Anti-Social Behaviour co-ordinators and joint action taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="Howdoimakeacomplaint" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<h3>How do I make a complaint?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complaints can be made to Environmental&nbsp;Health &amp;
Housing&nbsp;on 01553 616200 or by emailing <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" title="E-mail the Community Safety and Neighbourhood Nuisance Team" href="mailto:csnn@west-norfolk.gov.uk" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}">csnn@west-norfolk.gov.uk</a>, or
through your local Councillor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When making your complaint you must include: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, address and if possible a contact telephone
number;</li>
<li>The address complained of and the type of nuisance;</li>
<li>When and for how long the problem normally occurs; and</li>
<li>The way the nuisance affects you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anonymous complaints will not be
investigated.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="1355"></a>What will Community Safety &amp;
Neighbourhood Nuisance&nbsp;do?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will take your complaint and investigate.&nbsp; The nature of
your complaint will be discussed and you will be informed how we
will deal with your complaint.&nbsp; You must remember that your
complaint will not be resolved overnight, investigations can take
several weeks.&nbsp; A letter will be sent to the person you allege
to be causing the nuisance advising them of your complaint to try
and attempt a quick informal resolution to any problems that may
exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Your name and address will NOT be
disclosed to the person complained about, however, occasionally the
person may guess who has complained or may approach you to ask if
you have made a complaint. &nbsp;Also, if the Council decides to
take legal action, you may be asked to appear in Court as a
witness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A letter will also be sent to you acknowledging receipt of your
complaint and including a log sheet.&nbsp; You will be asked to
keep a record of when the nuisance occurs for 14 consecutive days
after which time the completed log sheet should be returned.&nbsp;
There are three reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>To help us assess whether the noise nuisance is likely to
amount to a statutory nuisance;</li>
<li>To indicate the times when an officer is more likely to witness
the nuisance; and</li>
<li>With your consent the log sheet may be used in evidence should
formal action prove necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the completed log sheet is not returned within 28 days it
will be assumed that the matter has been resolved to your
satisfaction and no further action will be taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon receipt of your completed log sheet the Officer dealing
with the complaint will attempt to witness the problem by visiting
your property at the time the nuisance usually occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the officer is satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists, an
Abatement Notice will be served upon the person(s) causing a
problem.&nbsp; Failure to comply with the Notice within the time
specified is a criminal offence and may result in formal action in
a Magistrates Court. Persons found guilty are liable to a fine up
to &pound;5,000 for a domestic property and up to &pound;20,000 for an
industrial/commercial property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some occasions where the Council is unable to take
formal action, either because the nuisance occurs intermittently or
a statutory nuisance cannot be substantiated.&nbsp; If the Council
decides that formal action cannot be taken, you will be advised
accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="1259"></a>Taking your own action</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, CSNN may not be able to take formal action, as we
have either been unable to witness the nuisance or do not consider
it to be a statutory nuisance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you nevertheless wish to pursue your nuisance complaint,
there are two alternative options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Taking action yourself in a Magistrates Court under section
82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.&nbsp; You will need to
contact your local court to ask how to proceed but it is a good
idea to write to the person causing the problem saying that unless
the nuisance is stopped by a certain date you will be complaining
to the Magistrates Court.&nbsp; Make sure any letter is dated and
signed and keep an accurate copy.&nbsp; This may be enough to solve
the problem or at least get it properly considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Taking action yourself for a 'private nuisance', which
involves your local County Court. &nbsp;This is a method which is
best adopted after consulting a solicitor and relies on you proving
on the balance of probabilities that your right to reasonable
enjoyment of your property has been seriously affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to taking any action you are advised to consult a
solicitor.&nbsp; Remember that opposing arguments raised by the
defence will have to be faced in court.&nbsp; Very often it is
found that relations between neighbours are strained and that the
nuisance complaint is just part of a greater and sometimes
complicated dispute.&nbsp; One thing you must do is be quite
certain of the grounds of your complaint and be sure you are not
overreacting to a situation which many people would find
acceptable.</p>
