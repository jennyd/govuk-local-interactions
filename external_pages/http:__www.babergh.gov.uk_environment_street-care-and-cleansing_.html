        <h1>Street Care and Cleansing</h1>        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">An efficient and effective street cleansing service is essential to provide the kind of environment that we would like to live in. The quality of the local environment, and in particular standards of street cleansing, are increasingly becoming the measure that the public uses to judge how well an area is being managed and its suitability as a place to live, work, visit or bring up a family. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our aim is to keep the District a clean, environmentally safe, well managed and pleasant place to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cleaner streets cannot be achieved solely through better cleansing - we need people to take responsibility for litter and waste in the first place - and where this doesn't happen we will seek to take robust enforcement action.</p>

Different areas of the districts are cleaned on different frequencies, but as a general rule, town centres are cleaned every day and rural areas as and when required.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">It is important to note however, that our schedules are flexible and we do not clean a street that does not need cleaning. The emphasis of the Council is to do our best to keep the district clean. That means that if you report areas (or we find areas) that have become a problem, we will deal with them rather than sticking to a schedule just because it exists.</div>

                            <p>Road side litter is one of the fastest growing litter problems. The high levels and speed of traffic on A classification roads makes clearing litter a dangerous proposition. The Environmental Protection Act 1990 makes allowance for this and as such litter clearance that might require road closure is to be performed when practicable and preferably incorporated in to other scheduled works. The litter clearance work for both Councils on the A14 &amp; A12 &nbsp;is covered part of a partnership scheme with Ipswich Borough Council.</p>

Where the defacement is on private property, the council encourages property owners to remove graffiti. &nbsp;However, if the defacement is offensive, the Councils are happy to work with the owners to remove the defacement as quickly as possible.</p><a href="/environment/street-care-and-cleansing/graffiti/" alt="What does the council do about graffiti?" title="What does the council do about graffiti?"> More information on <strong>What does the council do about graffiti?</strong></a>

<p>We do not clear leaves from private property (even if the leaves have fallen from Babergh trees) nor do we clear leaves from grass areas - the only exception to this rule are Babergh parks and Babergh sheltered housing sites, where leaves are routinely cleared from the whole site, including grass areas, on a weekly basis.</p>
