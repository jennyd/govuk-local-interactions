<p>A Tree Preservation Order protects trees which bring significant amenity benefit to the local area.</p>

<p>A <a title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/tposguideaddendum">Tree Preservation Order</a> makes it an offence to cut down, lop, top, uproot, wilfully damage or wilfully destroy a tree without written consent. There are substantial fines involved for a breach of a Tree Preservation Order.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/tree-preservation-orders/" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Planning Portal </a>provides detailed information and guidance Tree Preservation Orders &amp; Trees in Conservation Areas</p>
<h2>Protecting Trees</h2>
<p>If you think a tree should be protected and it is under threat of works likely to result in its destruction, you should contact our <a href="/council/611.asp">Tree &amp; Landscape Officer </a>as soon as possible. We will assess whether the tree fulfils an array of strict criteria before&nbsp;deciding whether the tree(s)&nbsp;will qualify for a Tree Preservation Order. For example, it must be sound and healthy and be of significant visual amenity value.</p>
<p>In the event we make a new Tree Preservation Order (TPO) you can comment on whether it should be made permanent. You should write to us within 28 days of the TPO being made. You should identify the trees in question and give your reasons. The Council will then take your comments into account when deciding whether or not to confirm the TPO. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.lewes.gov.uk/planning/18223.asp" >A Register of Tree Preservations Orders (TPOs)&nbsp;and&nbsp;TPOs being considered for permanent status </a>are available.<br /></p>
<h2>Responsibility for Trees </h2>
<p>The owner of the tree is responsible for maintenance of a protected tree, for its condition and for any damage which it causes. However, if a tree is subject to planning constraints such as a Tree Preservation Order, you will need to obtain permission from us before carrying out most types of works.</p>
<h2>Applying to Undertake Works to a Protected Tree</h2>
<p>Apart from limited exceptions, permission must be sought from the Council by submitting a standard application form. The form is available from the Planning Portal or from the Trees &amp; Landscape Officer. It is important that the information on the form makes clear what the proposed work is and provides adequate information to support the case. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/permissiontypes#ConsentunderTreePreservationOrders" title="This is a PDF link and requires Adobe Acrobat Reader">Tree Works application form</a> </li>
<li><a href="/Files/plan_treecuttingschedule.pdf" title="This is a PDF link and requires Adobe Acrobat Reader">Schedule of Proposed Tree Cutting Work form (pdf)</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/appPDF/Help031_england_en.pdf" title="This is a PDF link and requires Adobe Acrobat Reader">Guidance notes on completing the form</a></li></ul>
<p>If you wish to submit your application electronically please use <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/PpApplications/loginRegister.jsp" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Planning Portal's online submission </a>process.<br /><br />When we receive a written application to undertake works to a protected tree it is our policy to give local bodies and members of the public an opportunity to comment on the application. We will write to your local Councillor, Parish/Town Council and publish a list online. <br /><br />In considering applications we will assess the likely impact of the proposed works on the health and amenity value of the tree or woodland as well as the potential impact on the wider visual amenity of the area. We will also consider whether or not the proposal is justified, having regard to the reasons put forward in support of it.<br /><br />If we cannot agree with the proposed works we will write to you to explain why we have refused consent for your application. If on the other hand, the works are considered to be acceptable, written planning consent will be issued before the end of the eight-week period. <br /><br />In the event your application is refused, or part refused, you can appeal to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Planning Inspectorate </a>within 28 days of receiving the decision. The address and instructions on how to appeal can be found on the decision notice. Most cases will be dealt with on the basis of the original application and its supporting information, the decision of the Council and the reasons we gave when the decision was made. The Inspector may, however, ask for further information. Either party may if they wish have the appeal dealt with at a hearing or public local inquiry.<br /><br />If you receive planning consent for works to protected trees there will usually be conditions attached to that consent. This normally sets a time limit of two years when the works must be completed and will also require that the works conform to the latest version of British Standards (BS:3998) Recommendations for Tree Works. In the event a tree is cut down in breach of a tree preservation order or because it is dead or in a dangerous a condition to replant may be imposed.</p>
<h2>Site Visits</h2>
<p>You can seek the advice of the Tree &amp; Landscape Officer before making a tree work notification, but it is important to note that this is a discretionary service subject to time &amp; resource constraints.</p>
<p>Please be aware any advice given by the Tree Officer is without prejudice to the formal determination of your tree work application. This means that in the event the Tree Officer indicates support, or declines to support your application, this would not necessarily mean we will automatically grant or refuse consent for the works.</p>
<p>You can also get advice from a reputable <a href="http://www.lewes.gov.uk/planning/18221.asp" >tree work contractor and/or a consultant</a>.<br /></p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Please note the changes to the 'exceptions' list: You need the local planning authorityâs permission to work on a tree covered by a Tree Preservation Order unless:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;it is for cutting down trees in accordance with one of the Forestry Commissionâs grant schemes, or where the Commission has granted a felling licence;</p>
<p>2) cutting down or pruning a tree: </p>
<ul>
<li>which presents an urgent and serious safety risk â however you must give written notice (by letter or email) of the proposed work to the local planning authority as soon as practicable after the work becomes necessary; </li>
<li>which is dead â however you must give at least five working days written notice (by letter or email) of the proposed work to the local planning authority; </li>
<li>which is directly in the way of development that is about to start for which detailed planning permission has been granted; </li>
<li>in a commercial orchard, or pruning fruit trees in accordance with good horticultural practice; </li>
<li>to prevent or control a legal nuisance (you may find it helpful to check first with a solicitor); </li>
<li>in line with an obligation under an Act of Parliament; </li>
<li>by or at the request of certain organisations listed in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/605/made" title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website">Regulations 2012</a>.</li></ul>
<p>3)&nbsp; removing dead branches from a living tree </p>
<p>If you are in any doubt about what needs permission, check with the Trees &amp; Landscape Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: If you deliberately destroy a protected tree, or damage it in a manner likely to destroy it, <strong>you could be liable to an unlimited fine</strong>. You could also be fined if you cause or permit such work. Other offences can lead to fines of up to Â£2,500.</p>
<h2>Compensation </h2>
<p>It is sometimes possible to make a claim for compensation if you are refused permission to carry out work to a protected tree, or if conditions are attached to the permission. However, the legislation sets limitations and strict criteria that must be met. Claims should be sent to the local planning authority within 12 months of its decision, or within 12 months of the Secretary of Stateâs decision if you appealed.</p>
<h2>Replacement Trees</h2>
<p>If you cut down or destroy a protected tree you will have to plant a new tree if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You did so in breach of a Tree Preservation Order or without notifying your intention in a Conservation Area&nbsp; </li>
<li>You did so because the tree was dead or dangerous&nbsp; </li>
<li>You obtained permission but a condition requiring a new tree to be planted was attached to the permission&nbsp; </li>
<li>In most cases where the <a title="This is an external link. You will be leaving Lewes District Council's website" href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/">Forestry Commission</a> grants a felling licence</li></ul>
<h2>Land Charges</h2>
<p>When you purchase a property an official search of our <a href="http://www.lewes.gov.uk/housing/982.asp" >Land Charges Register </a>will reveal the existence of Tree Preservation Order or whether the property is within a Conservation Area.</p>
<p>Make sure your solicitor tells you if any trees are protected. You are advised to check with the <a href="http://www.lewes.gov.uk/council/611.asp" >Tree &amp; Landscape Officer</a> if you are unsure if your trees are subject to a Tree Preservation Order or any other relevant planning restrictions. </p>
