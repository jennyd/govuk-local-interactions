<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Following the implementation of changes to parking procedures in July 2005, Woking Borough Council now carries out enforcement of all the parking restrictions throughout the Borough, on behalf of Surrey County Council. Two exceptions to this are certain 'A' roads and Clearways which the police are responsible for enforcing. The enforcement regime is carried out in accordance with the terms of the Traffic Management Act 2004.</p>
<p class="back_to_top"><a href="#page_title">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="parking_restrictions">Parking restrictions</h2>
<p>It is important that drivers understand the waiting and loading restrictions that are indicated by the signs and lines that are present in the street, so they can comply with them and avoid receiving a parking ticket.</p>
<h3 id="single_yellow_lines">Single yellow lines</h3>
<p>These indicate that a waiting restriction applies at that place for a period of less than 24 hours in a day. The times when the restriction applies will also be indicated by a <strong>Time Plate</strong>, fixed on a pole or nearby building, which shows the operating times when waiting is prohibited outside a Controlled Parking Zone. Within a CPZ, unless signed separately, yellow line restrictions operate at identical times to the CPZ controls, as shown on the Zone entry sign (see below).</p>
<h3 id="double_yellow_lines">Double yellow lines</h3>
<p>These indicate that waiting at that location is prohibited at any time.</p>
<h3 id="controlled_parking_zones_cpzs">Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs)</h3>
<p>These are geographically defined areas within which all lengths of kerbside are subject to a waiting restriction. Within the Borough there are three CPZs covering Woking, West Byfleet and Brookwood. Yellow lines or designated parking bays indicate where parking is prohibited or permitted during the CPZ operating hours and the times when the restrictions apply are on the CPZ entry signs on the way into the zone.</p>
<p>Therefore, because a common restriction applies there will not necessarily be individual Time Plates in place throughout the zone. The exception to this occurs when a different restriction is in place in a particular location within the CPZ and then a supporting Time Plate will be displayed showing when the restriction operates.</p>
<p>Outside of the CPZ operating times, parking can take place on a single yellow line or in a bay without payment although drivers should not park where it would endanger or inconvenience pedestrians or other road users.</p>
<h3 id="loading_restrictions">Loading restrictions</h3>
<p>Vehicles may load/unload goods to or from an adjacent building while waiting on a single yellow line, providing a loading restriction does not apply at that location. This will be indicated by yellow kerb markings, one or more depending on whether the restriction is for part or all of the day, and a supporting time plate.</p>
<p>Loading or unloading may also take place from a parking bay, unless the bay has been taken out of service (suspended) for some reason. A vehicle must not wait where it would endanger or inconvenience pedestrians or other road users.</p>
<p>Civil Enforcement Officers will carry out a short period of constant observation to see if loading or unloading is taking place. If none is seen a Penalty Charge Notice will then be issued.</p>
<p class="back_to_top"><a href="#page_title">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="who_carries_out_enforcement">Who carries out enforcement?</h2>
<p>Woking Borough Council employs Civil Enforcement Officers (CEOs) who will enforce the waiting and loading restrictions on the street. These staff are easily identifiable in their uniforms.</p>
<p>Civil Enforcement Officers patrol the streets and carry out necessary observation on parked vehicles to determine if a contravention of the waiting or loading restrictions is taking place. This may be for not displaying a valid pay and display ticket or voucher, parking in a resident's bay or disabled bay without a valid permit, parking in a pedestrianised area or on the foot-way where it is prohibited or loading/unloading where it is not permitted.</p>
<p>The staff are specially trained and, as well as enforcing the restrictions, will also be able to give advice to drivers about all aspects of parking in the Borough. They aim to provide a professional service and improve traffic flows to minimise congestion for all road users.</p>
<p>CEOs will also patrol the town centre car parks and enforce parking regulations there by issuing the same type of Penalty Charge Notice as they do on-street.</p>
<p class="back_to_top"><a href="#page_title">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="penalty_charge_notices_pcn_-_how_to_pay">Penalty Charge Notices (PCN) - how to pay</h2>
<p>The PCN (commonly called a 'parking ticket') will show the contravention that the CEO believed was being committed. The level of the penalty charge is either Â£50 or Â£70, depending on the parking contravention.</p>
<p>Payment can be made by the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>By Telephone</strong>: Call the card payments line 01483 755855 Monday to Friday between 0845 and 1700, and quote the payment reference number if shown, or the PCN Number. <strong><em>You must</em> w</strong><em><strong>ait for at least 24 hours after the penalty notice was issued before using this facility, to allow time for the notice to be downloaded to our systems</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Online</strong>: at <a href="//">www.woking.gov.uk</a> and follow the link from the Pay for it button. <strong><em>You must</em></strong> <em><strong>wait for at least 24 hours after the penalty notice was issued before using this facility, to allow time for the notice to be downloaded to our systems</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>By post</strong>: please send cheques or postal orders (but not cash) made payable to Woking Borough Council with the PCN payment reference number written on the reverse, to:</p>
<p>Woking Borough Council<br>
Civic Offices<br>
Gloucester Square<br>
Woking<br>
GU21 6YL</p>
<p>If we receive your payment within 14 days after the date of the contravention, you will be entitled to a 50% discount. However, if you delay making your payment the full charge of Â£50 or Â£70 will immediately become due, which if left unpaid will automatically increase by 50% to Â£75 or Â£105 respectively.</p>
<p>If, after 28 days, you have not paid your PCN we will send a 'Notice to Owner' (NtO) to the registered keeper of the vehicle. This is a statutory notice that confirms to the registered keeper that a PCN has been issued, the contravention details, the amount payable and how to pay it, what will happen if it remains unpaid and how to appeal against it.</p>
<p><strong>Note that the registered keeper of a vehicle is the person responsible for any unpaid penalty charges. If you lend your car to a friend you will still be responsible for any charges they incur. It is also vital that you immediately notify DVLA of any change of ownership, as you will be responsible for any PCNs issued to a vehicle that remains registered in your name.</strong></p>
<p>If the PCN remains unpaid we will send a final reminder, usually within 56 days of the date of the original contravention, called a 'charge certificate', which increases the charge by 50% to Â£75 or Â£105. If the charge still remains unpaid we will then apply directly to the County Court for a warrant and will then appoint Bailiffs to recover any sums due. Court registration adds another Â£5 to the charge and if Bailiffs are instructed they will add their costs to the amount due.</p>
<p class="back_to_top"><a href="#page_title">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="how_to_appeal_against_a_pcn">How to appeal against a PCN</h2>
<p>In the first instance you should appeal, or make a representation, to Woking Borough Council. You can send your appeal by email to us at <a href="mailto:parking@woking.gov.uk">parking@woking.gov.uk</a>. or you can write to us. Our address is:</p>
<p>Parking Enforcement Services<br>
Civic Offices<br>
Gloucester Square<br>
Woking<br>
GU21 6YL</p>
<p>The PCN will be put on hold from when we receive your representation. Once a decision has been made we will write to you. If you are unsatisfied with our response and don't believe you should have received a PCN, you can appeal in writing to an independent adjudicator of the Traffic Penalty Tribunal. This is based in Manchester and acts as an independent appeals adjudication service for all PCNs issued outside London. Your case can be considered at a personal hearing or on written evidence only. Hearings are held locally for those who wish to attend a hearing in person. They have a website at <a href="http://www.patrol-uk.info/">www.patrol-uk.info</a> which provides information on the whole parking ticket appeal process.</p>
<p>The adjudicator will consider all of the information provided by both the motorist and the Council and make a final decision on whether or not the charge should be paid. Once the Tribunal have made a decision on a case there is no further route of appeal.</p>
<p class="back_to_top"><a href="#page_title">Back to top</a></p><h2 id="how_to_avoid_getting_a_parking_ticket">How to avoid getting a parking ticket</h2>
<h3 id="do">Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>check the lines and times on the signs which indicate when parking controls are in force and comply with them. Remember that in a Controlled Parking Zone there may not be signs at the location where you parked - they are located at the Zone entry points</li>
<li>make sure that you clearly display a valid Pay and Display ticket, voucher or permit in your windscreen (where necessary)</li>
<li>make sure you park properly, wholly within a marked parking bay</li>
<li>make sure that you have enough money to pay for your parking</li>
<li>make sure that you check the expiry time of your ticket and return to your car before it ends.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dont">Don't</h3>
<ul>
<li>assume you can park because other people have</li>
<li>assume you can stop for a short time on a yellow line - "I was only gone for five minutes" is no excuse</li>
<li>assume you can park on Bank Holidays or Sundays unless the sign says it's alright to do so</li>
<li>just think you're OK - be certain!</li>
