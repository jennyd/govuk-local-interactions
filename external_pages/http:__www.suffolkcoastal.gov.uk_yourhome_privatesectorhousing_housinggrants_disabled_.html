		<p>Disabled facilities grants are available for adapting dwellings to meet the needs of people with disabilities to enable them to live more independently in their own homes.</p>
<p>Grants are available for mandatory works as set out in the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, which was amended by the Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) Order 2002 and the Housing Act 2004.</p>
<h2>Who can apply for a grant?</h2>
<p>The owner of the dwelling, or a tenant if they can provide the necessary owner’s certificate or tenant’s certificate. This will not necessarily be the disabled person for whom the works are required. If you are a tenant you need your landlord’s permission.</p>
<p>The disabled person must intend to occupy the dwelling as their only or main residence for the next five years. For more information about conditions relating to eligibility contact the Private Sector Housing Team on <strong>01394 444506</strong> or email <a href="mailto:ps.housing.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk">ps.housing.scdc@eastsuffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<h2>What works could I have done?</h2>
<p>A wide range of works to enable access into and around the dwelling and access to or provision of essential amenities or facilities. Examples of works might include ramps, widening doors, showers in place of baths, and providing stairlifts. Also works to make the dwelling or building safe for the disabled person and other occupants may be applicable. All works must be supported by an occupational therapist.</p>
<h2>How much will the grant be?</h2>
<p>The maximum grant for mandatory works is £30,000. To ensure grants go to the most needy households the amount of grant is decided by a means test which looks at the income and capital of the disabled person and their partner. There is no means test in the case of applications for a disabled child.</p>
<p>We can carry out an informal means test over the telephone to give you an idea of what, if anything, you will need to pay towards the works. Please contact our Private Sector Housing Team on <strong>01394 444506</strong>.</p>
<p>Please note - for owner applications where the grant is over £5,000, the grant will be a charge on the property and any amount over £5,000 but not exceeding £10,000 will be recoverable on disposal of the property.</p>
<h2>How do I apply?</h2>
<p>The occupational therapist will advise our Private Sector Housing Team's grants officer of your needs.</p>
<p>Contact Suffolk County Council by calling Customer First on <strong>0808 800 4005 </strong>or email <a href="mailto:customer.first@suffolk.gov.uk">customer.first@suffolk.gov.uk</a> and ask for an occupational therapist to carry out an assessment.</p>
<p>Once you have registered with Customer First you will be asked to provide your financial details to us, so we can carry out a test of resources as required by the grant process to see if you qualify for a grant. If we cannot help you with grant aid we will try and signpost you to other assistance which you may have to fund.</p>
<p>For owner occupiers and private tenants, an agency can act as your agent and help with obtaining builders’ estimates, supervising works and obtaining building regulations and planning permission.</p>
<p>You will be able to discuss the adaptations needed and the proposed works with the occupational therapist, the grants/technical officer (and your agent). Additional technical advice may be sought if necessary.</p>
<p>Following this consultation, you and the occupational therapist will be sent a draft schedule of works for you both to check through to make sure the proposal is as expected. Then the application forms need to be completed. If you are using the an agency service, they will help you with this.</p>
<p>A new agency service is due to be commissioned in November 2015. More information on the current situation can be obtained by calling the Private Sector Housing Team. </p>
<p>You will not normally get a grant if you start work before we approve the application. In exceptional circumstances, if the works are urgent, you may be given written approval by us to start works before grant approval.</p>
<h2>What else do I need to know?</h2>
<p>If you do not get a grant because your means tested contribution exceeds the cost of the eligible works it could still be worth going through the application process so that any further adaptations, in the future, might be able to grant aided. Money you spend this time on adaptations can only be counted in the future if you go through the process. Ask the occupational therapist about joint funding or the grants officer about the effect of a 'nil grant approval' on any future applications. You may also be eligible for funding from charitable sources, ask the grants officer.</p>
<p>Some equipment is not eligible for grant aid but could be provided by social services, for example, hoists, grab rails, shower chairs - to enquire about eligibility contact Customer First by calling <strong>0808 800 4005 </strong>or email <a href="mailto:customer.first@suffolk.gov.uk">customer.first@suffolk.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not using an agency service, obtaining Building Regulation approval and planning permission (if required) is your responsibility.</p>
<p>Additional grants may also be available to help with serious disrepair - the grants officer will be able to advise you on these.</p>
