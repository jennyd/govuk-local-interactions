	<h2>Building control services</h2><p>Building control provide a statutory service to members of the public and construction industry in respect of building regulations. The service that we provide is to ensure that building work complies with the requirements of the building regulations. These regulations are designed to make sure that people are safe in and about buildings; to help conserve energy and to give access and facilities for people.</p><h2>What is building control?</h2><p>Building control provide a statutory service to the public and construction industry professionals in respect of the building regulations. Our main function is to administer the provisions of the building regulations and associated legislation to ensure a safe, healthy and sustainable built environment. In addition to this service Building Control undertakes ancillary duties that include the control of demolition works, dealing with dangerous structures, advice in relation to safety at sports grounds, and the giving of general advice to the council, construction professionals and the public.</p><p>To access any of these additional services, including reporting dangerous structures, please use the contact details on the left.</p><p>It is our prime responsibility to determine applications made under the building regulations so as to ensure that building works comply with the health, safety, energy conservation and access requirements, as laid down in the building regulations and the Building Act 1984. </p><p>Our main duties are as follows:</p><ul><li>Check plans to ensure the proposed&nbsp;work satisfies the standards of the building regulations </li><li>Inspect work on site as it progresses to ensure that buildings are safe, energy efficient and have reasonable access for all </li><li>Enforce the building regulations where standards are not met and undertake enforcement action when it is in the public interest. This is often a last resort as we endeavour to assist people as much as possible in achieving compliance with the regulations.</li></ul><h2>What are the building regulations?</h2><p>The building regulations apply to building work in England&nbsp;and Wales and set standards for the design and construction of buildings to ensure the safety and health for people in or about those buildings. They also include requirements to ensure that fuel and power is conserved and facilities are provided for people to access and move around and inside buildings.</p><p>Compliance with the standards of construction prescribed by the building regulations is a legally enforceable requirement.</p><p>It is therefore important to understand the building regulations as any person who carries out building work has a duty in law to comply.</p><p>If you are employing a builder, the responsibility will usually be theirs - but you should confirm this at the beginning. Also bear in mind that if you are the owner of the building, it is ultimately you who may be served with an enforcement notice if the work does not comply with the regulations.</p><p>The local authority has the duty under the Building Act 1984 to enforce the regulations, and in the proper performance of that duty it needs to verify new building work by inspection.</p><p>It must be acknowledged that the service does not provide a guarantee of compliance, or a quality control service. We may have inspected the work and issued a decision notice and completion certificate, but this is not a guarantee of compliance. Our involvement does not remove the responsibility of the person undertaking the work and the owner in meeting the requirements of the regulations. </p><p>Remember that complying with building regulations is a separate matter from getting planning permission for your work.</p>
