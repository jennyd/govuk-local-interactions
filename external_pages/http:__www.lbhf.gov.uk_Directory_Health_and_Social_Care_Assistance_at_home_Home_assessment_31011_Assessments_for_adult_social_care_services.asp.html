<p>The Care Act 2014 means we have changed the way in which we complete an assessment with youÂ  when deciding whether youÂ  will be eligible for funding forÂ  care and support from the council.</p>
<p>Before the Care Act we set our own eligibility criteria based on national guidance. This meant that the amount - and type of care provided by councils across the countryÂ varied,Â depending on where you lived. The Care Act has changed this.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide a care and support system built around you as an individual person, and focus on what you want to achieve.</p>
<h3>
<br />
<strong>
<a name="step1">
</a>Step 1:Â  Assessment: finding out what you need and want to achieve</strong>
</h3>
<p>Once you have let us know that you would like an assessment for adult social care services, we will contact you within two working days with an appointment to meet with you. We will complete your assessment within 28 working days. We will visit you at home or in hospital to carry out an assessment.</p>
<p>This assessment will give you the opportunity to tell us about you and your social care needs, so that we can assess whether whether you are eligible for funding from the council towards the cost of yourÂ adult social care and support.</p>
<p>If you are eligible for home care then you will be offered a short term period of focused support from the reablement teamÂ in the community independence service to help you to improve your independence.</p>
<p>How to get assessed</p>
<p>You can ask your council for an assessment yourself, or be referred by someone you know, or by a professional who is already involved in your care, such as a GP, community nurse, or mental health nurse. If you are being referred by someone else, that person should have discussed and agreed this with you in advance.</p>
<p>The assessment must be carried out with involvement from you and, where appropriate, someone who looks after you (perhaps a relative or friend). It can also involve someone else nominated by you to help you get your views and wishes heard, or an independent advocate provided by the council.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.1. What is an assessment?</strong>
</p>
<p>A needs assessment is a method of identifying your social care needs as defined by law. It is carried out through a meeting between yourself, the assessor or another member of staff and any relevant carers.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
1.2. What will I be asked in my assessment?</strong>
</p>
<p>The assessment considers if you can;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make choices for yourself</li>
<li>Stay healthy and safe</li>
<li>Manage your own daily routine (such as washing, showering and getting dressed, doing your laundry, housework and shopping, collecting your benefits and making a meal for yourself)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.3. What if I disagree with my assessment?</strong>
</p>
<p>You should contact the person who assessed you and ask for a reassessment. Their number will be on the letter that they sent to you or you can ask to speak to their team manager. If after this, you still feel dissatisfied with the outcome of your assessment, you can request a formal appeal.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.4. How long will I receive social care services for?</strong>
</p>
<p>Social care services are provided for as long as your needs meet the eligibility criteria. We will review the services that are in place after the first six weeks and then on an annual basis unless your circumstances or needs change.</p>
<p>If your circumstances or needs change, you should contact us at <a href="/Directory/Links/115323_h_and_f_advice.asp" ><strong>h&amp;f Advice</strong></a> on 0845 313 3935 - you do not need to wait for your review.</p>
<p>Our focus is on promoting independence and so, in many cases, services will be provided for a short period only. As your health or abilities improve, we will work with you to reduce our input.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>
<br />
<strong>
<a name="step2">
</a>Step 2: Regaining your independence (reablement)</strong>
</h3>
<p>If a period of short term, focused support would help you to increase your independence, we will refer you to our community independence service.</p>
<p>The community independenceÂ (reablement) service will meet you in your home within two days of completing your assessment, to develop a programme of short term focused support which can last up to six weeks.</p>
<p>Together we will set weekly goals around:</p>
<ul>
<li>regaining your confidence</li>
<li>rebuilding your skills and</li>
<li>increasing your independence</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also see if any equipment, assistive technology or an adaptation to your home would help you.</p>
<p>When your community independenceÂ programme finishes, you will be reassessed to see if you still require services, which will be set up immediately.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.peoplefirstinfo.org.uk/at-home/staying-in-your-own-home/regaining-your-independence.aspx">Regaining independence (People First website)</a>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
2.1. What will the service involve?</strong>
</p>
<p>AÂ coordinator will meet you in your home to develop a reablement programme of short-term intensive support with for eligible home care needs. All decisions about your reablement will be made with you. You and your co-ordinator will set weekly goals to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>regain confidence</li>
<li>rebuild your skills</li>
<li>increase your independence and</li>
<li>meet your care needs</li>
</ul>
<p>The team will then help you to carry out these activities as outlined in your reablement programme and goals sheet.</p>
<p>During this time we will also look at whether equipment, assistive technology or adaptations to your home may help you.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
2.2. What equipment and assistive technology is available?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is a wide range of specially designed equipment and assistive technology available to promote independence. This equipment or technology can help you in your everyday life; for example, grab rails, pendant alarms, a raised toilet seat, a commode, a special mattress,Â kitchen gadgets, a falls sensor, gps tracking and electronic medication prompters.</p>
<p>See <a href="/Directory/Health_and_Social_Care/Assistance_at_home/Care_and_scan_and_community_alarm_services/40213_Careline_and_telecare.asp" ><strong>Assistive technology</strong></a></p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
2.3. What adaptations can you make to my home?</strong>
</p>
<p>Home adaptations may help to give you more freedom into and around your home and help you to access essential facilities within it. They normally include the type of works where structural changes are needed to your home such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>fitting a stair lift</li>
<li>replacing a bath with a walk-in shower or fitting a shower over the bath</li>
<li>adapting your home for wheelchair use (e.g. widening doors, installing ramps or a ceiling track hoist)</li>
</ul>

</strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.4. How long does theÂ programme last?</strong>
</p>
<p>The (reablement) programmeÂ will last as long as you are seeing improvements to your confidence, skills and independence, usually up until a maximum of 6 weeks. exceptionally longer.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
2.5. What happens next?</strong>
</p>
<p>When yourÂ programme finishes we will reassess you to see if you are still eligible for services.</p>
<p>If you are, we will write to you within three days of your reassessment to tell you what your likely budget is (see step 3) and we will set up any services that you need until your support plan is approved (see step 4).</p>
<p>If you are no longer eligible for an adult social care service, we will write to you within three days of your reassessment and tell you where you can find other services.</p>

<h3>
<br />
<strong>
<a name="step3">
</a>Step 3: Your budget: money to spend on meeting your social care needs</strong>
</h3>
<p>If you are eligible for a service, we will work out the amount of money to which you are likely to be entitled to meet your social care needs. You may use this money to spend on things that meet your needs in ways that make most sense to you.</p>
<p>You can manage your budget yourself by taking a direct payment. This means that we will pay your budget directly to you. You can also ask the council to manage your budget for you, or you can have a combination of the two.</p>
<p>You may be required to contribute to the cost of your service. If so, our finance team will contact you to ask you to complete a financial assessment form.</p>
<p>If you need any help completing the form you can telephone 0800 840 4502.</p>
<p>See <a href="/Directory/Health_and_Social_Care/Services_for_the_elderly/Direct_payments/16026_Direct_Payments.asp" ><strong>Direct payments</strong></a></p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.1. What is a budget?</strong>
</p>
<p>A budget is the amount of money that we have assessed will meet your social care needs. It is how much you or we have to spend on the support you want to put in place to meet your social care needs.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.2. What will it cost me?</strong>
</p>
<p>It does not cost anything to have an assessment, but there may be a charge for some home care services. Whether you have to pay is determined by the Department of Healthâs Fairer Contributions Guidance which takes into account your income and your expenses.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.3. Will this budget affect the amount of money I must pay the council in charges?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. If you contribute to the payment of your care services, you will still continue to do so. For those who pay financial contributions, the total budget will be made up from the amount of money allocated to you by the council plus your contribution. You must not use your budget to pay for any charges.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.4. Will this budget affect any of my benefits?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, this money is not counted as an income, so it will not affect any of your benefits.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.5. How is my budget managed?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can choose how your budget is managed. It can be paid to you as a direct payment for you to arrange your services or you can ask us, the council, to manage it for you and to arrange your services. You can also have a combination of the two where part of your budget is managed by us and part by you.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.6. What is a direct payment?</strong>
</p>
<p>A direct paymentÂ is money paid to you every four weeks in advance from your budget to pay for services or activities that you have chosen in your support plan. This can be the most flexible way to manage your support, because you are paid the money every 4 weeks in advance. You must have a separate bank account for us to make the payment into.</p>
<p>Before we give a direct payment we must be sure you want a direct payment and you are able and willing to manage the money on your own or with help.</p>
<p>If the council finds you are not managing a direct payment, we can withdraw the payments and arrange care for you.</p>
<p>If you are unable to manage your direct payment because of a lack of mental capacity then we can pay it to someone else on your behalf, providing they are willing, suitable and it is appropriate.</p>
<p>See <a href="/Directory/Health_and_Social_Care/Services_for_the_elderly/Direct_payments/16026_Direct_Payments.asp" ><strong>Direct payments</strong></a></p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
3.7. If I manage the budget myself, do I have to tell you how I am spending it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>
<br />
<strong>
<a name="step4">
</a>Step 4: Support planning: your plan telling us how you will use your budget</strong>
</h3>
<p>You can now decide how your budget should be spent by choosing services and activities that best meet your social care needs. Your choices will be set out in your support plan, which can take up to four weeks to complete.
<br />
You can create your support plan with family and friends and you can also have help from our reablement team or from one of our support planners.</p>
<p>You can ask the Direct Payment Support Service for information and advice about direct payments. One of our managers will check that your plan meets your assessed needs and is safe.</p>
<p>Once your support plan is approved, you can put it into action.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
4.1. What is a support plan and care plan?</strong>
</p>
<p>A support and care plan tells us what you want to change in your life, what you want to stay the same and how you would like to spend your budget to meet your needs. It describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>your hopes, goals and the steps you will take to improve your quality of life</li>
<li>how you will meet the needs that were identified in your assessment</li>
<li>the support you think you will need</li>
<li>who you wish to provide the support</li>
<li>how much it will cost</li>
<li>how it will be arranged and managed</li>
<li>what happens if difficulties arise</li>
<li>how your plan will be reviewed with you</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
4.2. What can I spend my budget on?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can spend your budget on services that meet your needs. We have not provided a list of what you can spend your budget on because everyoneâs support plan will be different but some examples might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>employing a personal assistant to help take care of you instead of having a carer from an agency</li>
<li>joining a voluntary group to meet new people</li>
<li>agreeing more flexible times with your home care providers so you can get up and go to bed when it suits you</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>You cannot spend your budget on:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>anything that does not meet your assessed needs and outcomes</li>
<li>anything that is against the law</li>
<li>gambling</li>
<li>NHS treatments</li>
<li>services or care for your husband, wife or civil partner</li>
<li>paying your partner or close relatives who live in the same household as you. (Your support planner can advise what is included as âclose relativesâ).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
4.3. Who can help me to create a support plan?</strong>
</p>
<p>You will be asked who you prefer to help you to complete the support plan.</p>
<p>You may wish to plan your support on your own or with your family or friends who you trust.</p>
<p>We can also help you to make these decisions by assisting you to create a support plan.Â Either your assessor, social worker, reablement co-ordinator or support planner, as appropriate, will meet with you and support you in creating the support plan.</p>
<p>You can ask the Direct Payment Support Service for information and advice about direct payments.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
4.4. What is a support planner?</strong>
</p>
<p>Support planners work with people who have a large budget, complex needs or who want to be particularly creative in using their budget.</p>
<p>If you have a support planner they will help you to think about what is and isnât working in your life and help you to think about different ways in which you can spend your budget to meet your needs and maximise your independence.</p>
<p>The support planner will help you to think about your whole life and not just your assessed needs. They will then help you think about accessing other free services and activities or things that you may want to spend your own money on.</p>
<p>They will also help you to understand the practicalities of putting your plan into action so that your choices are achievable.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
4.5. How will you approve my plan?</strong>
</p>
<p>A manager will check that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the support plan meets the needs that were identified in your assessment</li>
<li>you have set personal and achievable goals and outcomes</li>
<li>your plan is safe and that any risks have been identified and addressed</li>
<li>you have a plan in place if things go wrong</li>
<li>you have chosen how you want to manage your personal budget</li>
<li>your plan is affordable</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
4.6. What happens if my plan is not approved?</strong>
</p>
<p>A plan might not be approved if it does not meet the above criteria. In this case you will be contacted to discuss any areas that need to be changed. If you are not happy with any changes that are suggested you should ask to speak with a team manager. If after speaking with them you still feel dissatisfied, you can request a formal appeal.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>
<br />
<strong>
<a name="step5">
</a>Step 5: Putting your plan into action</strong>
</h3>
<p>Once your plan has been approved it needs to be put in to action. Where we are arrangingÂ services for you, any changes to your existing service will be in place within two days of your support plan being approved.</p>
<p>If you take a direct payment you have to set up a separate bank account for it to be paid into and set up any services that you are managing yourself. You can ask the Direct Payment Support Service to help put your plan into action.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
5.1. Who can help me set up the services?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you have chosen a council managed service, we will arrange your services.</p>
<p>If you have chosen a direct payment you will have decided who will help you set up your services as part of your support plan. You can also ask the Direct Payment Support Service to help you set up the services.</p>
<p>If you have decided to employ a personal assistant, the Direct Payment Support Service can help you. They can give you advice and support about your responsibilities as an employer, recruitment, tax and insurance.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
5.2. What if the services I have chosen in my plan stop being available?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you have chosen a council managed budget we will contact you to discuss alternatives.</p>
<p>If you have chosen a direct payment and are unable to find an alternative service, you should contact <strong><a href="/Directory/Links/115323_h_and_f_advice.asp" >h&amp;f Advice</a></strong> on 0845 313 3935.</p>
<p>
<a href="#top">Top of page</a>
</p>
<h3>
<br />
<strong>
<a name="step6">
</a>Step 6: Review: checking that your needs are being met</strong>
</h3>
<p>Six weeks after your plan has been put into action we will contact you to check that things are going well and that your needs are being met. After this your plan will be reviewed at least once every 12 months.</p>
<p>You can contact us at any time if you are not happy with the services you are receiving or if your circumstances or needs change by telephoning h&amp;f Advice on 0845 313 3935 or by contacting your allocated worker.</p>
<p>We check that your needs are being met by meeting with you. This is called a review. You will have your first review 6 weeks after you have set up your support plan. Your needs and support plan will then be reviewed at least once every 12 months.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
6.1. What if my needs have changed since my last assessment?</strong>
</p>
<p>If your eligible needs have increased since your last assessment, your budget and support plan will be reviewed and your budget may be increased to ensure your needs are being met.</p>
<p>If your needs have decreased since your last assessment, your budget and support plan will be reviewed and your budget may be reduced. An appropriate date for this reduction will be agreed with you, but it is likely that you would receive at least two weeks' notice if this were the case.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<br />
6.2. What if my needs change or my plan isnât working for me before I have a review?</strong>
</p>
<p>If your circumstances or needs change, you should contact us at <strong><a href="/Directory/Links/115323_h_and_f_advice.asp" >h&amp;f Advice</a></strong> on 0845 313 3935 - you do not need to wait for your review.</p>
