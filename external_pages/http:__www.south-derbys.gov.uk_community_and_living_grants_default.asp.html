<p>The Community Partnerships Scheme</p>
</div>
<img src="/Images/grantsfinished300_tcm21-84611.jpg" alt="Completed work" />
<p>The Community Partnerships Scheme has been developed to provide support, advice and grant funding to community projects in South Derbyshire. <a href="/community_and_living/grants/community_partnership_scheme/default.asp" >Further details about the Community Partnerships Scheme</a></p><h2>Other grants</h2><p>We match revenue funding from Derbyshire County Council with a small amount of grant funding to a large number of elderly persons clubs throughout the area.</p><h3><strong>Facilitation Fund - Strengthening Disabled People's User-Led Organisations Programme</strong></h3><p>UK wide - Office for Disability Issues  no specific deadline</p><p>Short term (up to 18 months) financial support for Disabled Peoples User-Led Organisations&nbsp; to increase their sustainability in the future, or to enable new DPULOs to be created.&nbsp; Organisations can apply for up to £30k over the course of the programme, which runs until March 2015, as one application or several.&nbsp; To date, the average award is £12,500. DPULOs are defined as organisations that are led and controlled by disabled people (minimum 75% of disabled people on their board); employ disabled staff and volunteers; are actively committed to the Social Model of Disability.&nbsp; The Facilitation Fund will also consider organisations which can demonstrate they are working to achieve the above definition. There is no closing date for applications and you should hear the outcome of your application within approximately 2 months.</p><h3><strong>Derbyshire Community Foundation</strong></h3><p>DCF manages and awards local grants on behalf of a range of funders and funding programmes.&nbsp; There is also guidance about applying for grants. For more information visit their website: <a title="Derbyshire Community Foundation" href="http://www.foundationderbyshire.org/" target="_parent">www.foundationderbyshire.org</a></p><h2>BBC Children in Need</h2><p>Small Grants Programme open to not-for profit groups.</p><p>Upto £10,000 available as grants that target projects to combat disadvantage and make a real difference to children and young peoples lives. Specifically targeting:</p><p>Children and young people of 18 years and under experiencing disadvantage through:</p><ol><li>Illness, distress, abuse or neglect</li><li>Any kind of disability</li><li>Behavioural or psychological difficulties</li><li>Living in poverty or situations of deprivation</li></ol><p>In the Small Grants programme they are looking for projects where a relatively small amount of money can make a big difference for children and young people. They are unlikely to fund applications which top up funding for salaries or larger projects where a small grant would only make a marginal impact on its success.</p><p>Apply any time - cut-off dates 1 June, 1 September, 1 December, 1 February.</p><h2>Local Strategic Partnership</h2><p>The Partnership Development Officer supports the engagement of the voluntary and community sector in the <a href="/council_and_democracy/partnerships/south_derbyshire_local_strategic_partnership/default.asp" >Local Strategic Partnership</a> working primarily through the South Derbyshire Voluntary Sector Forum.</p><h2>Compact</h2><p>Statutory and voluntary and community organisations have been asked by central government to agree a "<a href="/council_and_democracy/partnerships/derbyshire_compact/default.asp" >Compact</a>" to act as a guide to future relationships. The Council is committed to developing a local compact, which should prove vital in improving relationships for mutual advantage. It should:</p><ul><li>help all parties understand and value the roles, nature and contribution of different kinds of organisations</li><li>include undertakings on all sides and mechanisms to make sure it works</li><li>set standards for communication, consultation and support</li><li>provide a practical tool to aid partnership working and service delivery</li></ul><h2>Partnership working</h2><p>The Leisure and Community Development Section maintains links with the voluntary and community sector through its representation on a variety of partnerships. These include Derbyshire Community Legal Services Partnership, South Derbyshire Voluntary Sector Forum, Derbyshire Learning Partnership, Derbyshire Childrens Strategic Partnership Local Implementation Group and the Southern Derbyshire Rural Transport Partnership.</p><p>In addition, in a spirit of partnership, the Council offers support in the form of desk space and associated administration to the Project Development Manager of the Old Post Regeneration Agency (OPRA).</p><p>OPRA are concerned with the regeneration of Newhall, Midway and Stanton and amongst their achievements is the redevelopment of the former New Inn in Newhall into a multi-purpose community facility called The Old Post. This centre now acts as the organisations base.
