<h2><a id="intro" name="intro"></a><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p>8.1 There has been a significant change to transport policy in recent years. It is now widely accepted that continued road building based on 'predicting' future traffic levels and 'providing' accordingly is not the solution to transport problems. Such an approach is now deemed inappropriate given that it encourages more traffic, is detrimental to the environment and is poor value for money. The emphasis is now on reducing the need to travel (particularly by private car), investing in more sustainable alternatives and further integration of land use planning and transportation.</p>
<p>8.2 European Union policy and legislation is bearing an ever increasing influence on domestic transport policy. The European Union's Common Transport Policy states that its long term aim is to provide sustainable mobility by providing coherent integrated transport systems and measures to ensure that transport contributes towards sustainable development patterns by respecting the environment and contributing towards the solution of major environmental problems.</p>
<p>8.3 The Government's recent White Paper 'A New Deal for Transport' advocates an integrated approach to transport and land use planning. Preference should be given to measures favouring the most sustainable forms of transport. This will relieve road space of many journeys, particularly short ones, currently made by the car. The Government is in the process of reviewing much of its planning guidance and integrating the new transport agenda figures prominently.</p>
<p>8.4 PPG13 (Transport) issued by Central Government in 1994 was the first comprehensive national policy statement seeking greater integration of transport and planning.</p>
<p> In seeking greater integration, it seeks to: </p>
<ul>
<li> reduce the growth in the length and number of motorised journeys; </li>
<li> encourage alternative means of travel which have less environmental impact; and hence </li>
<li> reduce reliance on the private car.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.5 Revised PPG 13(March 2001) gives greater locational guidance, advocates further travel demand measures and seeks to divert developer contributions to sustainable modes of transport. In particular, it introduces Transport Assessment, provides encouragement for park and ride schemes and promotes widespread use of travel plans. PPG13 sets maximum parking standards for a range of types of development at a level to promote use of alternatives to the car.</p>
<p>8.6 The Road Traffic Reduction Act (1997) requires the Council to monitor traffic levels and set targets for a reduction in the volume of road traffic growth. Land use policies which seek to reduce reliance on the private car will contribute towards meeting these targets.</p>
<p>8.7 The Government has recently issued a draft National Air Quality Strategy and local authorities are required to review and assess their air quality by the end of 1999. Where this review and assessment identifies areas in which air quality objectives are likely to be breached, Air Quality Management Areas will be identified. This clearly has implications for land use and transport planning as the main pollution issue in the Borough is emissions from traffic. By promoting a development pattern which reduces the need to travel by car for short journeys which produce a disproportionate level of pollution, land use planning can make a contribution to improving air quality.</p>
<p>8.8 RPG Regional Planning Guidance for the North East is currently being reviewed. The Draft Guidance makes reference to ensuring that land use planning and transport are integrated in order to steer development to locations which reduce the need to travel and enable journeys to be made by more sustainable modes of transport.</p>
<p>8.9 This Guidance is being complemented by a Regional Transport Strategy which is being prepared by the recently formed Regional Assembly which comprises local authority, private sector, other public sector and voluntary sector representatives. This will build on the Guidance contained within Regional Guidance for the North East and set priorities for investment.</p>
<p>8.10 The White Paper on Transport requires Local Authorities to develop integrated local transport strategies, which are set out and implemented through a Local Transport Plan. A Provisional Local Transport Plan for Tyne and Wear was published in the Summer of 1999. The provisional plan enables the transition to take place between the former approaches to planning and financing Local Transport Strategies and the new methods of working through the Local Transport Plan. The provisional plan sets the objectives for the full plan and makes substantial progress towards defining methods of assessing local transport needs and future implementation programmes.</p>
<p>8.11 The Local Transport Plan will address the key transport problems facing the area during the next 15 years. It will set out appropriate, affordable and acceptable strategies to bring out improvements in local transport systems. Strategies of Local Agenda 21 and Towards 2010 - A Public Transport Strategy (Nexus) will be fully integrated as part of the Local Transport Plan's delivery. Through the LTP, the local authorities will play a vital role in delivering Government policy and local aspirations for local transport plans.</p>
<p>8.12 Similarly, the LTP has a role in achieving the targets set for the Air Quality Strategy and transportation policies within the Plan, particularly through the requirements of the Road Traffic Reduction Act, will make a substantial contribution towards the improvement of the local environment.</p>
<p>8.13 The &quot;full&quot; LTP will run from 2000 - 2016. The plan will address the transport needs of Tyne and Wear as a whole. These needs will be assessed jointly by the Districts and City Councils and Nexus. Stakeholders in the Local Transport systems will be actively involved in the preparation and delivery of the plan through the development of partnerships. Local Transport Characteristics</p>
<p>8.14 Much of the built-up area of the Borough is served by the Metro system giving high levels of public transport accessibility between settlements and to Newcastle. The Borough is also well served by a comprehensive network of bus services, principally focused on Newcastle and Whitley Bay, but which is generally complementary to the Metro system. A Ferry operates between North Shields and South Shields with a regular four to six crossings per hour.</p>
<p>8.15 The Strategic Highway network and Metro System are shown on the Proposals Map.</p>
<p>8.16 The Borough's dispersed settlement pattern and separate identity areas give rise to different local transport characteristics.</p>
<p>8.17 The older town centres of North Shields, Wallsend and Whitley Bay all suffer problems of pollution, congestion and road safety caused by the demands of the motor car on a 19thC built form and street pattern. This is mitigated to some degree in central North Shields and Wallsend by a low car ownership of about 35% of households and by high accessibility to the public transport network, particularly Metro. Whitley Bay also enjoys good access to public transport but car ownership in the coastal area is well above the Borough average of 53% and close to the national average at about 67% of households. The suburbs to the north of North Shields and Wallsend display car ownership levels generally close to or above the Borough average.</p>
<p>8.18 The outer settlements of Shiremoor and Backworth show car ownership levels close to the national average and are also served by the Metro system at Shiremoor. Traffic on the A186 through Shiremoor is unacceptably high in relation to the standard of road and the effect on the local residential environment.</p>
<p>8.19 Settlements in the north west of the Borough function largely as suburbs of Newcastle and this is reflected in the traffic flows and public transport provision. Car ownership in these areas is generally similar to the Borough average of 53% except for the Longbenton estate where it is low at 33% of households and the Wideopen area where it is close to the national average of 66%. Public transport in this part of the Borough focuses on the custom built bus/Metro interchange facilities at Four Lane Ends serving the area north to Killingworth and at Regent Centre in Newcastle serving the Dudley and Wideopen areas. The Longbenton Estate is served by its own Metro Station which is currently being refurbished.</p>
<p>8.20 The Council recognises that the relatively low car ownership in the Borough and consequent potential for further growth raises concerns about environmental pollution, traffic congestion, road safety and the depletion of non-renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>8.21 The Council also recognises that large sections of the population will continue to remain dependent on public transport to fulfil their travel needs. These are often the most vulnerable sections of the community: the poor, the elderly, children and people with special needs. Public transport will remain important to maintain social and economic opportunities for these groups.</p>
<p>8.22 UDP policies and proposals present a major opportunity to influence the rate of growth in car usage and increase public transport patronage. </p>
<h3><a id="pol_prop" name="pol_prop"></a> POLICIES AND PROPOSALS</h3>
<h4><a id="pub_trans" name="pub_trans"></a> Public Transport</h4>
<p> 8.23 Wherever possible the Council will use its powers and influence to promote the extension and improvement of public transport facilities in the Borough. </p>
<p>This will be achieved by: </p>
<ul>
<li> Giving increased prominence to bids for public transport funding in the Tyne and Wear Local Transport Plan submissions in partnership with the Passenger Transport Authority and its Executive. </li>
<li> Considering the accessibility of development proposals by public transport and assessing major development proposals through Transport Assessments. </li>
<li> Promoting the implementation of Travel Plans amongst schools and employers which encourage the use of public transport for the journey to work and school. </li>
<li> Incorporating the national minimum parking standards for larger scale development set out in PPG13 (March 2001). </li>
<li> Encouraging well-designed and well-conceived park and ride schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.24 Larger scale development proposals should be accompanied by Transport Assessments, replacing Traffic Impact Assessments, indicating the potential mode split of journeys to and from the site. The Transport Assessment should also identify proposed measures to manage and improve transport infrastructure and services, in particular to promote the use of public transport, cycling and walking.</p>
<p>8.25 PPG13 (March 2001) requires Travel Plans to be submitted alongside planning applications which are likely to have significant transport implications, including those for:</p>
<ul>
<li> all major developments comprising jobs, shopping, leisure and services (using the same thresholds as set out in Annex D of PPG 13 (March 2001)); </li>
<li> smaller developments comprising jobs, shopping, leisure and services which would generate significant amounts of travel in locations where there are local initiatives or targets set out in the development plan or local transport plan for the promotion of public transport, walking and cycling. This particularly applies to offices, industry, health and education uses; </li>
<li> new and expanded school facilities which should be accompanied by a school travel plan which promotes safe cycle and walking routes, restricts parking and car access at and around schools, and includes on-site changing and cycle storage facilities; and </li>
<li> where a travel plan would help address a particular local traffic problem associated with a planning application, which might otherwise have to be refused on local traffic grounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.26 Development plans are required to set maximum levels of parking for broad classes of development by PPG13(March 2001). Maximum standards are to be used as part of a package of measures to promote sustainable transport choices, reduce the land-take of development, enable schemes to fit into central urban sites, promote linked-trips and access to development for those without use of a car and to tackle congestion. There should be no minimum standards for development, other than parking for disabled people.</p>
<p>8.27 Park and ride schemes will be subject to robust assessment, including consideration of alternative sites, the impact on local amenity, and travel impacts, including traffic reduction and generation. Where their use is appropriate, schemes need to be designed and implemented in association with other measures, such as public transport improvements, traffic management and parking controls. Schemes should be designed for use by disabled people, and to promote the potential for walking cycling and motorcycle journeys to and from the site.</p>
<p>8.28 This policy aims to facilitate the provision of attractive alternatives to the motor car, promote environmentally sound modes of transport, improve mobility and accessibility for non motor car users particularly those with special needs and reduce pollution, congestion and accidents. PPG13 (March 2001) Local Agenda 21, and Local Transport Plans, require local authorities to achieve an improved and more sustainable transport strategy. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T1" name="T1"></a><strong>T1 THE COUNCIL WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.29 New development will be encouraged where good accessibility to public transport infrastructure already exists and especially where there is underused capacity, for example, close to Metro stations and interchange facilities. As well as promoting and encouraging the use of public transport this will reduce the need to establish new provision elsewhere. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T2" name="T2"></a><strong>T2 DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS WHICH UTILISE SPARE CAPACITY IN THE EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORK WILL BE ENCOURAGED.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="routes" name="routes"></a> Public Transport - Routes/Sites</h4>
<p>8.30 In order to be able to extend and enhance the capacity of the public transport network in the future options for expanding the system need to be identified and potential routes and sites safe guarded from proposals which would compromise their possible development. Development options include extensions to Metro, dedicated bus routes, bus stations, additions to the suburban rail network, heavy rail passenger/freight link to Newcastle Airport and ferry landing stages. Although extensions to the system may not take place within the UDP timescale it is essential, if opportunities for a shift away from life styles dependent on the motor car are to be maximised, that potential routes and station sites are not compromised by other developments.</p>
<p>8.31 Although there are currently no proposals to close the existing rail freight line between the Borough boundary south-east of Seghill and Benton Quarry junction its long term future as a potential public transport corridor linking south-east Northumberland with Newcastle City Centre should be safeguarded. (Policy T3). A suburban rail link would be the most likely development option. Consultants have been appointed to develop proposals for the extension of a passenger rail link to Ashington via Backworth/Shiremoor</p>
<p>8.32 It is possible that the potential of the existing Railtrack east coast main line to provide local suburban rail links in the area between Durham and Morpeth could be realised in the future although probably not within the timescale of the current plan. This could result in the development of new suburban stations with fast links to central Newcastle along the existing Railtrack line. Possible station sites should be safeguarded. (Policy T3).</p>
<p>8.33 Safeguarding the former rail connections east of Benton Metro station will allow links to be established between Metro and the Railtrack main line should this become desirable in the future. (Policy T3). </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T3" name="T3"></a><strong>T3 DEVELOPMENT WHICH WOULD OBSTRUCT OR CONSTRAIN THE POTENTIAL USE OF EXISTING AND FORMER RAILWAYS AND WAGONWAYS AS COMMUNICATION CORRIDORS FOR A VARIETY OF TRANSPORT USES SUCH AS FOOTPATHS, CYCLEWAYS, BRIDLEWAYS, BUSWAYS, METRO, HEAVY RAIL OR AS OTHER HIGHWAYS WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.34 The proposed Metro Complementary Route (MCR), also known as the Stephenson Corridor Jobs Link, is a multi-modal public transport project, being promoted by Nexus and North Tyneside Council. The ongoing major residential, industrial, commercial and leisure developments along the A19(T) development corridor require public transport services to improve accessibility and social and economic activity along the corridor and beyond via the Metro system. The MCR has been designed to achieve this by linking new ferry landings at South Shields and Royal Quays, a new Interchange at Percy Main Metro Station and a new Metro and Bus Interchange to be constructed at Backworth. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T3a1" name="T3a1"></a><strong>T3/1 THE METRO COMPLEMENTARY ROUTE SHOWN ON THE PROPOSALS MAP WILL BE SAFEGUARDED FROM DEVELOPMENT AND RESERVED FOR A POSSIBLE FUTURE PUBLIC TRANSPORT CORRIDOR AND STATIONS.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.35 A new Metro station west of Shiremoor and east of the A19(T) bridge is proposed to serve the residential growth point at Shiremoor/ Backworth. It is anticipated that high accessibility to the Metro and fast journey times to Newcastle will discourage car usage, benefit non motor car users including people with special needs, make the area attractive to developers and attract population into the Borough. Its position adjacent to the A19(T) presents the opportunity to be linked to the metro complementary route and incorporate 'park and ride' facilities enabling car borne travellers originating in south-east Northumberland to park here and travel by Metro into Newcastle City centre.</p>
<p>8.36 A new Metro station is proposed at Beaconsfield, Tynemouth making the site potentially highly accessible to non motor car users including people with special needs. In addition to improving public transport accessibility for local residents the proposal will enhance the visitor potential of existing and proposed facilities in the area including the Sea Life Centre, Tynemouth Park and Long Sands. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T3a2" name="T3a2"></a><strong>T3/2 NEW METRO STATIONS ARE PROPOSED IN THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS: </strong> <strong> (1) SHIREMOOR (SHOWN ON THE PROPOSALS MAP). </strong> <strong> (2) IN THE VICINITY OF BEACONSFIELD TYNEMOUTH, THE EXACT LOCATION TO BE IDENTIFIED AFTER DETAILED ENGINEERING STUDIES, AND HAVING REGARD TO THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON LOCAL AMENITY, THE ENVIRONMENT AND ADJOINING LAND USES.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.37 In order to increase the attractiveness of public transport and to improve accessibility for non motor car users deficiencies in bus station provision at important locations should be made good.</p>
<p>8.38 The intended redevelopment of Killingworth Town Centre will present the opportunity to incorporate new bus station facilities at this important transport node where none exist at present.</p>
<p>8.39 The ongoing major residential, industrial, commercial and leisure developments at Royal Quays together with the potential for further large scale industrial development in the area require the provision of new bus terminus facilities. A site should be identified in the vicinity of the car/ferry terminal which is capable of integration with a possible future pedestrian/ferry landing stage. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T3a3" name="T3a3"></a><strong>T3/3 SITES FOR NEW BUS TERMINI SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND SAFEGUARDED AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS: </strong> <strong> (1) KILLINGWORTH TOWN CENTRE </strong> <strong> (2) ROYAL QUAYS</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.40 An increase in the availability and range of river ferry services would improve accessibility and social and economic activity along the riverside. Major development at Royal Quays for a variety of uses including residential and recreational facilities presents the opportunity to provide anew ferry landing facility and to link with other public transport proposals for the area and particularly the Metro Complementary Route link. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T3a4" name="T3a4"></a><strong>T3/4 A SITE FOR A FUTURE FERRY LANDING STAGE WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND SAFEGUARDED FROM DEVELOPMENT AT ROYAL QUAYS </strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="ops" name="ops"></a> Public Transport Operation/Facilities</h4>
<p>8.41 In order to increase the attractiveness of travel by public transport, thereby reducing the adverse influences of the motor car, particularly in the built up area, a high priority will be given to ensuring the efficient movement of buses, easy access to bus stops and Metro interchanges and to improving the range of passenger facilities. The bus strategy for Tyne and Wear identifies key corridors (termed as primary upgraded bus routes) where the aim is to implement a core network which provides comprehensive modern services and infrastructure. These will be implemented through quality partnerships, in addition to metro complementary routes (MCRs), to serve the most heavily trafficked corridors.</p>
<p>8.42 Improvements to passenger facilities could include better design of bus stops and shelters, improved lighting, seating, signage and safety measures. Where bus station improvement is proposed consideration should be given to items such as waiting room facilities, provision for baby changing and feeding, play areas, toilets and access for the disabled.</p>
<p>8.43 The Council in partnership with Nexus have an on-going programme of C.C.T.V. introduction and car park security measures at metro station park and ride sites. Nexus and the Council are providing cycle storage lockers at key metro stations. New proposals for park and ride include those concerned with Backworth interchange and a major scheme bid for interchange improvement at Four Lane Ends. The Council will continue to seek locations for park and ride at alternative locations on the network. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T4" name="T4"></a><strong>T4 A HIGH PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO ASSISTING PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATION BY GIVING PRECEDENCE TO BUS MOVEMENTS ON CONGESTED ROUTES, IN TOWN CENTRES AND AT METRO INTERCHANGES AND BY PROMOTING IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSPORT PASSENGER FACILITIES</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.44 To perform well, public transport operations must provide accessibility and reliability. The council, as highway authority can assist in improving performance by implementing a variety of physical measures including the provision of bus priority measures on major bus corridors. Additional measures providing for the needs of public transport can be included in the council's highway improvement schemes.</p>
<p>8.45 It is important that new development reflects the needs of public transport, and wherever possible, provides good access for buses. This may mean for example, ensuring attractive, clearly defined through routes and the provision of lay-bys.</p>
<p>8.46 Improvements to the highway network will adopt the appropriate design criteria to assist bus operation. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T4a1" name="T4a1"></a><strong>T4/1 PUBLIC TRANSPORT PROVISION WILL BE ENCOURAGED BY IMPROVING OPERATING CONDITIONS AND FACILITIES.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.47 Priority will be given to areas where public transport patronage is greatest and where proposals form part of wider traffic management schemes aimed at reducing the adverse influence of the motor car such as Town Centres. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T4a2" name="T4a2"></a><strong>T4/2 PRIORITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE GIVEN TO IMPLEMENTING PASSENGER FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS: </strong> <strong> (1) TOWN CENTRES </strong> <strong> (2) METRO INTERCHANGE FACILITIES </strong> <strong> (3) METRO STATIONS</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.48 Planned improvements such as easier access through the avoidance of steps, the use of seating and clearer information signs would remove many of the barriers facing public transport users. Section 57(2) of the Transport Act, 1985 requires Passenger Transport Authorities and their Executives to have a 'duty ...... to have regard to the transport needs of members of the public who are elderly or disabled'. The Disability Discrimination Act 1997 requires service providers to have implemented the provision of accessible facilities/vehicles by a certain timescale. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T4a3" name="T4a3"></a><strong>T4/3 THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE REFURBISHMENT OF EXISTING FACILITIES, SHOULD INCLUDE ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS AND FACILITIES SUITABLE FOR DISABLED PERSONS AND OTHERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="taxis" name="taxis"></a> Taxis</h4>
<p>8.49 Taxis form an important element of the public transport system although they carry fewer passengers than other forms. They offer a twenty-four hour service geared to a market where individuals require a journey tailored to their own particular requirements. They are particularly valuable for the elderly, those with disabilities and by women concerned for their safety. It is therefore desirable to ensure that ranks for taxis are in locations which are safe and convenient for both operators and users.</p>
<p>8.50 The potential for providing new taxi ranks will be examined at important transport nodes and concentrations of community facilities such as town centres, out of town shopping areas and Metro stations.</p>
<p>8.51 The possible affects on amenity of additional taxi ranks and private hire offices will be considered. Planning criteria are set out in Development Control Policy Statement 20. (Taxi/Private Hire Offices) </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T5" name="T5"></a><strong>T5 THE USE OF TAXIS WILL BE ENCOURAGED BY THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL RANKS IN A VARIETY OF SUITABLE LOCATIONS.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="highways" name="highways"></a> Highways</h4>
<p> 8.52 Due to the priority given in this plan to measures aimed at increasing the attractiveness of public transport and promoting alternatives to the private motor car no additions to the strategic highway network are proposed. The existing network will, however, be upgraded where this will improve safety and efficiency provided there is no conflict with environmental policies. Improvements could include road widening, dualling, junction improvements and by passes. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T6" name="T6"></a><strong>T6 THE HIGHWAY NETWORK WILL BE IMPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COUNCIL'S GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF: </strong> <strong> (I) IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT, AND </strong> <strong> (II) IMPROVING SAFETY AND CONVENIENCE ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY, AND </strong> <strong> (III) PROTECTING AND IMPROVING THE BUILT AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, AND </strong> <strong> (IV) IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR PEDESTRIANS, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND </strong> <strong> (V) PROVIDING FOR CYCLISTS; AND OTHER NON- MOTORISED USERS,AND </strong> <strong> (VI) IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY TO MAIN EMPLOYMENT, RESIDENTIAL AND OTHER AREAS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER THE NEED TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF A HIGHWAY IN ORDER TO MEET SOME OR ALL OF THESE GENERAL OBJECTIVES.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.53 The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and Regions is the highway authority for the network of trunk roads in England. The Highways Agency, an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, is responsible for the management and maintenance of this network and the delivery of the targeted programme of improvements. The core trunk road network in North Tyneside consists of the A1 (T) and the A19 (T). Under the Town and Country Planning General Development (Procedures) Order 1995 the Secretary of State has the power to direct a planning authority to refuse a planning application or to require it to attach conditions to the planning permission. This is to ensure that traffic associated with the new development does not prejudice the operation of the trunk road. Where a development is likely to generate a material increase in traffic which would result in junctions and/or the main line of the trunk road becoming overloaded, the Secretary of State would normally advise (but, if necessary, direct) the LPA to refuse the planning application. Alternatively,if direct access could be designed for the usual 15 year design horizon or improvements to the indirect junctions/main line could be designed, consistent with the current policy of no worse off 15 years after opening, the Secretary of State could advise (or again, if necessary, direct) the LPA to impose conditions on any planning permission that the development should not proceed unless and until those improvements have been carried out.</p>
<p>8.54 In addition to securing whatever highway works are required under these arrangements, developers will normally be required by the Highways Agency to pay a commuted lump sum for their future management. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T6a1" name="T6a1"></a><strong>T6/1 THE FOLLOWING MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HIGHWAY NETWORK ARE PROPOSED AND SHOWN ON THE PROPOSALS MAP: </strong> <strong> (1) A19(T) RIVER TYNE CROSSING DUPLICATION </strong> <strong> (2) A1056 'NORTHERN GATEWAY' IMPROVEMENT - A1(T) TO A189 </strong> <strong> (3) A1056 IMPROVEMENT - A189 TO A19 </strong> <strong> (4) A186 SHIREMOOR BY PASS </strong> <strong> (5) A191 WEST ALLOTMENT BY PASS </strong> <strong> (6) A191 HOLYSTONE BY PASS </strong> <strong> (7) NORTH SHIELDS RIVERSIDE LINK ROAD </strong> <strong> (8) HIGH FLATWORTH EXTENSION</strong></p>
</div>
<p>8.55 T6/1 (2) and T6/1 (3) are major schemes (+Â£5m) to be appraised by the Local Transport Plan partners across Tyne and Wear.</p>
<p>8.56 Central government support has now been confirmed for a Private Finance Initiative public/private partnership for the new Tyne crossing. The new crossing is to be located immediately down stream of the existing Tyne Tunnel. On 8 April 1998, the Tyne Tunnels Act 1998 passed through Parliament. The act confers on Tyne and Wear PTA powers for the construction and operation of an additional Tyne crossing and allows changes to be made in the procedures for operating the existing Tyne Tunnel. These new powers enable progress of the proposed private finance initiative for the construction and operation of the new crossing. The expected opening of the new tunnel will be 2005.</p>
<p>8.57 The proposed improvements to the A1056 (Policy T6/1(2) &amp; (3)) are required to relieve traffic congestion and delay on this strategic route linking the A1(T) and A19(T) trunk roads.</p>
<p>8.58 The proposed A186 Shiremoor By Pass and A191 West Allotment and Holystone By Passes (Policy T6/1(4), (5) &amp; (6)) are required to upgrade existing substandard lengths of the Strategic Highway network, remove large volumes of through traffic from residential areas and service the substantial development proposed in this Plan in the Shiremoor, West Allotment and Holystone areas. The upgrades would also improve the strategic links to Newcastle Airport. Newcastle Airport plays an important role in the strategic and economic development of the region. Over the next decade the airport's importance to the economy is anticipated to grow strongly. To accommodate forecast growth, the airport company is to undertake substantial investment in terminal facilities. The airport's land use Masterplan includes substantial maintenance and freight development.</p>
<p>8.59 The proposed North Shields Riverside Link Road (Policy T6/1(7)) linking Dock Road with New Quay will reduce traffic on Borough Road, Prudhoe Street and Howdon Road and improve the efficient routeing of buses. It would also facilitate the redevelopment of the former ship repair yards known as Appledore and Smith's Dock.</p>
<p>8.60 The proposed High Flatworth extension (Policy T6/1 (8)) will connect the Tyne Tunnel Trading Estate with Silverlink providing greater ease of movement within the wider A19(T) corridor employment zone particularly for public transport.</p>
<p>8.61 Improvements and additions to the local highway network will be necessary before substantial development can be accommodated. Developers will be required to enter into planning obligations or other legal agreements to secure the necessary highway modifications. The Council will consider among other matters the traffic and environmental capacity of existing and proposed roads in reaching its conclusions on the most appropriate arrangements for new highway infrastructure and will negotiate with developers to secure a contribution to pay for any necessary works.</p>
<p>8.62 In the case of trunk road improvement works the Highways Agency has stated that these works will be secured by a planning condition and will be fully funded by the developer. The Highways Agency also requires that all further development affecting the trunk road network may need to be the subject of a Transport Assessment.</p>
<p>8.63 Details of Council policy regarding Planning Obligations and developer contributions are set out in Policy DC3. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T7" name="T7"></a><strong>T7 DEVELOPMENT REQUIRING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HIGHWAY NETWORK WILL NOT BE ALLOWED UNLESS: </strong> <strong> (I) APPROPRIATE CONTRIBUTIONS RELATED DIRECTLY TO THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSALS ARE OBTAINED FROM DEVELOPERS; </strong> <strong> (II) THE OPERATIONAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS OF THOSE AFFECTED BY DEVELOPMENT ARE PROPERLY SAFEGUARDED; </strong> <strong> (III) IT IS AGREED WITH THE APPROPRIATE HIGH WAY AUTHORITY; AND </strong> <strong> (IV) APPROPRIATE PROVISION IS MADE FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT, PEDESTRIANS, CYCLISTS AND HORSERIDERS.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="cyclists" name="cyclists"></a> Cyclists</h4>
<p>8.64 Bicycles are an extremely environmentally sound mode of transport and their increased use could contribute to a reduction in motor car pollution and traffic congestion. Increased provision of routes could encourage and assist the use of the bicycle for journeys to work, to shop, to school and for recreation.</p>
<p>8.65 In December 1997, the Council endorsed its Cycling Strategy and Plan. The function of this strategy is to co-ordinate all policies and programmes of action which can help to promote cycling. It incorporates objectives, targets, policies/mechanisms, and a borough wide plan which form the basis of the strategy. A network of routes covering the whole borough and measures to make cycling safer and more attractive are identified and shown in the Cycling Strategy and Plan. The cycling strategy and plan will be reviewed on a regular basis. Priorities for the implementation of the cycle routes will be assessed against the strategy and plan. The net work will be improved and extended as opportunities arise and resources permit.</p>
<p>8.66 To further encourage the use of cycles all new developments will make provisions for cycles in a convenient, secure and overlooked location for short stay parking. For longer term parking a more secure site preferably within a building with the necessary security measures taken will be encouraged. A &quot;Sheffield&quot; style rack or equivalent alternative (offering provision for two cycles, robustness and degree of protection to users) should be installed - details of construction and installation of &quot;Sheffield&quot; style racks are available from the Council.</p>
<p>8.67 Facilities to accommodate cyclists will be incorporated into highway improvement schemes whenever the opportunity arises. Bicycle parking provision will be encouraged at a range of possible destinations such as town centres, Metro stations, sports centres, libraries and Council offices. The Local Planning Authority's bicycle parking standards are set out in Development Control Policy Statement 4. (Car and Cycle Parking Standards). The standards indicate the minimum level of provision of cycle parking required by the Council. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T8" name="T8"></a><strong>T8 CYCLING WILL BE ENCOURAGED BY: </strong> <strong> (I) PROVIDING A SIGNED NETWORK OF CYCLE ROUTES SEPARATE, WHERE POSSIBLE, FROM MAJOR TRAFFIC FLOWS; </strong> <strong> (II) ENSURING THAT CYCLISTS' NEEDS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DESIGN OF HIGHWAY AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SCHEMES; </strong> <strong> (III) ENSURING CYCLISTS' NEEDS ARE CONSIDERED AS PART OF NEW DEVELOPMENT AND WHERE APPROPRIATE REQUIRING THAT FACILITIES, INCLUDING PARKING, ARE PROVIDED, TO SATISFY OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS; </strong> <strong> (IV) PROVIDING CYCLE PARKING FACILITIES AT APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS; </strong> <strong> (V) PROVIDING ACCESS TO ROAD SPACE OTHERWISE SHARED BY BUSES AND SERVICE VEHICLES WHERE APPROPRIATE; AND </strong> <strong> (VI) PROVIDING EDUCATION TRAINING AND PUBLICITY WHICH ENCOURAGE SAFE AND GOOD CYCLING PRACTICE.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="peds" name="peds"></a> Pedestrians</h4>
<p>8.68 This policy aims to promote measures designed to encourage the use of non-polluting modes, which include walking. People without access to a car, including children and people on low incomes, are heavily dependent on walking. The plan therefore includes measures that improve the pedestrian environment, whilst recognising that personal safety is an important issue for people on foot. In this regard, routes shall be on logical desire lines to ensure maximum usage, be well lit and readily capable of surveillance; planting or other features should not be positioned in a manner which may provide opportunities for criminal or threatening behaviour. They should be surfaced with a finish appropriate to the level and type of use, and well signposted.</p>
<p>8.69 Careful design of the pedestrian environment is particularly important for people with disabilities for whom badly laid out and poorly maintained pavements are particularly dangerous. Street furniture can be hazardous for blind people if it is not consistently positioned and detectable with a cane and can impede the free movement of others. Road crossings with dropped kerbs and tactile surfaces are safer for blind people and people with pushchairs and in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>8.70 Development Control Policy Statement 2 ('Access for All') sets out other relevant criteria. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T9" name="T9"></a><strong>T9 THE NEEDS OF PEDESTRIANS, INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS, WILL BE GIVEN A HIGH PRIORITY WHEN CONSIDERING TRANSPORT AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="demand" name="demand"></a> Traffic and Travel Demand Management</h4>
<p>8.71 This policy aims to improve the safety and efficiency of all forms of traffic movement particularly in areas of high pedestrian activity such as town centres. Traffic management measures will be used to establish clear priorities for access by different means of travel. Wherever possible these measures will be used to encourage the use of alternative modes of transport to the motor car. Traffic management measures will be utilised to reduce the penetration and domination by motor vehicles of sensitive locations such as residential areas, shopping streets and near schools. The Council is implementing measures to reduce the dependency of children on the car for travel to school and improving the safety of the routes they use through it's Safer Routes to School initiative.</p>
<p>8.72 While conventional public transport remains inaccessible to many disabled people adequate provision must be made for the parking of vehicles of the registered disabled. Adequate provision should also be made for taxis and special buses to set down and pick up passengers close to town centres bearing in mind the mobility ranges of disabled persons. </p>
<div class="policy2">
<p><a id="T10" name="T10"></a><strong>T10 TRAFFIC CALMING AND LOCAL SAFETY SCHEMES WILL BE CARRIED OUT TO REDUCE CONGESTION, POLLUTION AND ACCIDENTS, LESSEN CONFLICT BETWEEN VEHICLES AND PEDESTRIANS, INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS, AND IMPROVE THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><a id="parking" name="parking"></a> Parking</h4>
<p>8.73 The availability of car parking has a major influence on the choice of means of transport. It can also take up a large amount of space in development reducing densities and degrading environmental quality. In order to limit the use of the motor car particularly within the congested parts of the built up area, as part of overall traffic management, car parking requirements will be kept to the minimum commensurate with location, operational needs, the need to encourage alternative modes of transport and the need to protect environmental quality. The Local Planning Authority's parking standards are set out in Development Control Policy Statement 4 (Car and Cycle Parking Standards).</p>
<p>8.74 New car parks should be designed to minimise the risk of crime against people and vehicles by making, wherever possible, all parts of each parking area visible to users.</p>
<p>8.75 New development should provide appropriate parking facilities for people with disabilities. </p>
<div class="policy1">
<p><a id="T11" name="T11"></a><strong>T11 PARKING REQUIREMENTS WILL, IN GENERAL, BE KEPT TO THE OPERATIONAL MAXIMUM AND SHOULD INCLUDE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS. </strong></p>
