<p>As part of our commitment to quality services, we aim to provide a reliable and quick repair service to our tenants.</p>
<p>This section tells you about the repairs service and explains our responsibilities as the service provider, as well as your responsibilities as a tenant.</p>
<h2>Report a repair</h2>
<p>Call our Housing Response Team on 01530 454635</p>
<h3>When?</h3>
<p>8.45am to 5pm, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday</p>
<p>Thursday 9.30am to 5pm.</p>
<p>Email:&#160;<a href="mailto:repairs@nwleicestershire.gov.uk">repairs@nwleicestershire.gov.uk</a></p>
<p>You may also report a repair at the Council Offices.</p>
<h3>Emergency repairs</h3>
<p>Call 01530 454789 between 5pm and 8.45am or during weekends and Bank Holidays.</p>
<p>Please note: If you demand an out of hours emergency call out when the repair could have been dealt with reasonably within normal working hours, there may be a charge.</p>
<p><a href="pages/out_of_hours_repairs">Find out more about emergency repairs</a> - read this before you call us.&#160;</p>
<h3>Help us improve</h3>
<p>We would like to know how effectively we carried out your repair. This will allow us to monitor our service and identify areas that fall short of our tenants' expectations.</p>
<p><br />
<span class="boldstyle">Please print off the form and complete the relevant sections as your repair progresses. By completing this form you will automatically be entered into a quarterly prize draw. One completed monitoring sheet will be chosen and vouchers to the value of £25 will be awarded.</span></p>
<h2>Bogus callers</h2>
<p>All of our workers, contractors, and officials carry identity cards which they will always show to any resident before entering their homes.</p>
<p>Cards have a telephone number to contact us - so you can confirm the employee is genuine.</p>
<p>Utility companies and other organisations also operate similar identity card or password systems.</p>
<p>If you have any doubt about the identity of anyone calling at you home, then call us or your local police straight away. DON'T LET ANYONE IN - if we're genuine, we won't mind, whatever the weather.&#160;</p>

<p><span>As well as explaining what day we will call, we will also confirm a morning or afternoon appointment.</span></p>
<p><span>For planned repairs which generally require an inspection, we aim to offer you an appointment before the work is done. Also at the time of inspection we'll arrange a further appointment for the work to be completed.</span></p>
<p>But not all repairs will need an appointment (work to the outside of your home, for example).</p>
<p>For emergency repairs you will need to guarantee access to your property for the following 24 hours.</p>
<p>You will not be given a set appointment but will be able to negotiate a time when you will be at home to make sure the emergency work can be done.</p>
<p>You will receive written confirmation of your appointment, and of the repair.</p>

<p>But if you have other repairs that are outstanding you should ask the contractor and depending on the nature of the job, they will try to complete that work wherever possible,</p>
<p>Please be aware that contractors also have other appointments with tenants that they must keep and do not always have the necessary equipment and materials to do other work.</p>
<p>For safety reasons some work can only be carried out by certain contractors, such as gas repairs that can only be done by Gas Safe registered plumbers.</p>

<div class='faq_detail collapsable-module'><div class='header'><h3><a class='faq_link' href="faq/how_long_will_the_repair_take">How long will the repair take?</a></h3></div><div class='body description faq_detail_hidden'><p>We have guidelines on how long different repairs should take.&#160;The main types of repairs are:</p>
<h4><span class="boldstyle">Emergency work:</span>&#160;w<span class="boldstyle">ithin 24 Hours</span></h4>
<p><span class="italicstyle">These are repairs which if not dealt with very quickly could cause injuries or further damage. This includes things like burst pipes, blocked drains,securing windows or doors, and loss of electricity.</span></p>
<p>In the event of an emergency you should contact the Housing Response Team on 01530 454635 for advice on what actions can make the property safe.</p>
<p>If you can't carry out the advice yourself and a neighbour, family member or friend can't help, the a worker will call that day.</p>
<p>If you call between 5pm and 8.45am Monday to Friday, or on a weekend or Bank Holiday&#160;on 01530 454789 a contractor will call and make the property safe.</p>
<p>Where the contractor makes the property safe, a return visit will be arranged to finish the repair the next working day.This will happen unless parts are not available or it is not an emergency, then it will be done within the relevant category and timescale.</p>
<p>If that happens the repair will be completed at the earliest opportunity. We will advise you of progress until the repair is complete.</p>
<p>If you are vulnerable or have special needs, we will take appropriate measures in addition to the make-safe policy. For example, temporary heating may be provided in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Vulnerable tenants will receive a quicker response to emergency work such as heating and hot water repairs, all year round.</p>
<h4><span class="boldstyle">Urgent work: w</span><span class="boldstyle">ithin seven days</span></h4>
<p>These are repairs which need quick attention and don't require an inspection first.<br />
These include re-fixing toilet seats and repairing minor leaks.</p>
<h4><span class="boldstyle">Routine work: w</span><span class="boldstyle">ithin 28 days</span></h4>
<p>These are less urgent repairs such as leaks to a gutter, repairing a noisy heating system or fitting a light switch.<br />
Some of these repairs may need to be inspected before the repair can be done.</p>

<p>You will be asked to pay for any repairs that have been caused by damage to, or misuse of your home caused by you, your family or friends.</p>
<p>However, the contractor will not ask you for any money when they call.</p>
<p>Your housing officer will be able to tell you more about what repairs you may be asked to pay for and how to pay.</p>
<p>You have the right to appeal if you don't agree with a decision to charge you for repairs.</p>

<p><span class="boldstyle">Any contractor doing work on our behalf will treat you and your home with courtesy and respect.</span><br />
They will try to cause as little mess and disruption as possible and will use dustsheets to protect your home.<br />
They will do their best to clear up when finished and remove any rubble or materials that day.</p>
<p>The contractor will tell you:</p>
<ul>
<li>What work they have come to do</li>
<li>Which rooms they will need to work in</li>
<li>Roughly how long the work will take</li>
<li>Whether your gas, electricity or water will need to be turned off and for how long.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
From time to time we may need to gain access to your home to do a survey. This could be for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to major repairs being undertaken</li>
<li>To update records on the condition of your property</li>
<li>To carry out specialist surveys.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Do not allow any person into your home if they do not carry the relevant identity card.</span></p>
