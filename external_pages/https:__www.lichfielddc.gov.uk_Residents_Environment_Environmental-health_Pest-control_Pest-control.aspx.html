<p>In partnership with MITIE Pest Control we provide a service for the treatment of ants for which there is a charge - visit our <a title="Book a pest control service" class="sys_0 sys_t47" href="/Residents/Environment/Environmental-health/Pest-control/Book-a-pest-control-service.aspx">pest control page</a> to find out more. If you intend to carry out your own treatment, read the label of the pesticide container and follow the instructions carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Common Black Ant, Garden Ant (Lasius niger)</strong></p>
<p>Typical worker ants are 3-4mm long of a brown/black colour with elbowed antennae and biting month parts. The queen tends to be much larger at about 10mm.</p>
<p>Garden Ants usually nest outdoors in lawns, flower beds, beneath paving slabs and at the base of walls. Premises are usually invaded by worker ants foraging for food, especially sweet foods. During summer, winged females (Queens) and males leave the nest on one or two warm afternoons and take flight. During this flight, which may only last for 2-3 hours, the ants mate. The formation of a new colony starts with a mated winged female digging into the earth to hibernate thought the winter and start a new colony in the spring.</p>
<p>If possible, trace the trail of worker ants to the nest. If the nest can be exposed, and it is safe to do so apply an insect powder labelled for that use. If it is not possible to trace the nest, use a residual insecticidal spray to treat outside the building. Special attention should be paid to likely entry points such as door frames, air bricks and waste pipes to create an insecticidal barrier. In addition, use of gels and liquid feeding baits can help with longer-term control.</p>
<p><strong>Pharaohs Ant (Monomorium pharaonis)</strong></p>
<p>The Pharaohs Ant is a small ant of tropical origin. The workers are only 2mm long, the queen 5mm long and both are yellow in colour. The ant has a characteristic double segmented waist and a darkened tip to the abdomen.</p>
<p>In temperate climates it is an indoor species, associated particularly with large facilities such as hospitals, prisons and blocks of flats. Unlike some other ant species, the queen may be replaced by other queens. This is an important feature to bear in mind during control, as new queens can be produced when needed resulting in colonies which are able to split.</p>
<p>A thorough survey by professional personnel is highly recommended. Pharaoh Ants are most often found in areas near a source of moisture such as kitchens or bathrooms. The use of conventional residual treatments is generally not effective as they may cause the nest to fragment. Baiting may be effective if the active ingredient is slow acting. Good results have been shown by using Juvenile Hormone based treatments. The treatment consists of applying bait to areas frequented by the ants, which works by stopping the ants from breeding and so they naturally die off. You will usually notice a reduction in the number of ants within 28 days, but it may take longer to kill off all the insects. Although modern treatments are very effective, there are rare occasions when it does not completely work.</p>
<p><strong>Ghost Ant (Tapinoma melanocephalum)</strong></p>
<p>The ghost ant is sometimes called the black-headed ant. This ant is very small about 1.5mm, with a dark head and thorax. The pale coloured, almost translucent abdomen and legs, in addition to its size, gives the ghost ant its name.</p>
<p>Although having only arrived in the UK in the last few years, and still relatively rare, the Ghost Ant is spreading quickly, particularly in large housing developments. The Ghost Ant colony can be moderate to large in size, containing thousands of workers and numerous queens. The colony is usually divided into sub-colonies; this is because the areas where the Ghost Ants prefer to build nests are usually too small to house their huge numbers. Different Ghost Ant colonies do not attack one another and will even integrate with their neighbouring Ghost Ants. Ghost Ants have a preference for sweet foodstuffs. Outdoors they feed on the honeydew from aphids and mealy bugs; indoors they will seek out sugar, sweets, syrup, honey and jam.</p>
<p>Spraying with a residual insecticide where trails are seen is more likely to achieve results than with Pharaoh Ants, however, because of their size and ability to form new nests, re-infestation often occur in other parts of the building. Combination treatments with gels and liquid baits are advised.</p>

<p>Bed Bug adults are reddish-brown, oval, flattened insects from 4-5mm long and 1.5-3mm wide before feeding. Engorged adults tend to be swollen and dull red.</p>
<p>The eggs are white, oval, about 1mm long and covered in a sticky film which allows them to adhere to surfaces. A newly hatched nymph is almost colourless whereas engorged nymphs are reddish and swollen.</p>
<p>Although humans are the preferred host, bed bugs feed on many warm blooded animals. Bed Bugs usually hide in cracks or mattresses during the day and emerge at night to feed.</p>
<p>They inject saliva as they feed and allergic reaction to this substance often causes slightly delayed swelling, itching and burning. Under favourable conditions, each female lays 200 to 500 eggs and at temperatures above 21&deg;C these hatch in 6 to 17 days.</p>
<p>Adults often survive up to two months without food, but under certain circumstances can live a year or more without feeding.</p>
<p>The first step to dealing with bed bugs is to locate their hiding places. Furniture, fittings and even crevices in wallpaper must be inspected carefully, even to the point of dismantling bed etc. for easier inspection and possible treatment.</p>
<p>Applications are best done to a 'crack to crevice' treatment to known or potential harbourages, as well as using a broad band residual insecticide through a coarse sprayer or as an Ultra Low Volume Insecticide for the rest of the room. Products containing insect growth regulators can also aid control.</p>

<p><i>Please note - we do not offer a pest control service to collect or exterminate Honey Bees. The following is for information only.</i></p>
<p>Honey bees have been commercially spread throughout the world for their unique produce.&nbsp;Honey Bees differ from wasps; they are hairy with dark brown/pale orange banded colouring.</p>
<p>The queen is larger than the other honey bees and can live for up to 8 years where average Bees will live for about 6-7 weeks in the mid-season but longer if they overwinter.</p>
<p>In an average year the queen can lay 900 eggs and more than 1 million during her lifetime.</p>
<p>Each nest or colony will have one fertile queen who lays the eggs; the other females (workers) are infertile. Depending on their age a few will leave the nest to search for sources of nectar or pollen where the remaining proportion will tend the queen, feed larvae, guard the nest, prepare honey and produce new wax honeycombs.</p>
<p>If the colony becomes too large the queen will produce a number of new queens. Whilst the new queens are pupating the old queen will leave the nest with up to 10,000 worker bees, this is known as a swarm.</p>
<p>Eventually the queen along with the swarm will cluster in a ball on a tree branch or wall while a scout will search for a new suitable location to start a new nest.</p>
<p>Once the swarm has found a new location the old queen will continue to produce eggs and the colony with thrive once more.</p>
<p>At the old nest the first new queen to emerge will sting the other un-emerged queens to death. She will mate with a male drone and take over the nest.</p>
<p>Honey Bees can swarm for several reasons one of which is to form a new colony.</p>
<p>The swarm is not dangerous while it is clustered as long as it is left alone. It is best however to call a bee keeper when you first find the swarm because if it stays in the same location for more than two days it can become bad tempered as the bees get hungry.</p>
<p>Before you call a bee keeper try and obtain the following information it will help him/her to assess the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do they look like?</li>
<li>What are they doing?</li>
<li>How long have they been there?</li>
<li>When did you notice them?</li>
<li>How many are there?</li>
<li>How far from the ground are they?</li>

<a name="DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_4"></a><a href="#DynamicJumpMenuManager_Top1" class="sys_backtotop">Back To Top</a><h2>Cat and dog fleas</h2>
<p>Adult fleas are 2-3mm in length and generally of a shiny brown appearance. They have a thin, laterally flattened body and large hind legs which allow them to jump onto passing hosts.</p>
<p>Flea eggs are about 0.5mm long, oval, pearly-white in colour and laid indiscriminately in the fur or feathers of the host or in its nest or bedding. Four to eight eggs are laid after each blood meal and a single female may produce 800 - 1000 eggs during her lifetime, which may be as long as to years.</p>
<p>The larvae thrive in the dark, humid places such as animal bedding and carpet fluff, and feed on organic debris and adult flea excrement. Cats bedding may support a flea population of 8000 immature and 200 adult forms.</p>
<p>Where very high populations of fleas are present, a single application of insecticide may not be sufficient, as even a 99% kill rate can still leave sufficient survivors to form the basis of a new infestation.</p>
<p>In such cases, additional treatments will need to be carried out until the infestation is eradicated. All floors and upholstered furniture should be vacuumed to remove animal hairs, organic debris, flea eggs and pupae. Dispose of vacuum bag in an outside bin.</p>
<p>Any cat and dogs should be treated for fleas with an insecticide recommended for this purpose and pet bedding should be destroyed or washed. All floor areas should then be treated with a residual insecticide or a desiccant spray from skirting board to skirting board.</p>
<p>In partnership with MITIE Pest Control we provide a service for the treatment of flees for which there is a charge - visit our <a title="Book a pest control service" class="sys_0 sys_t47" href="/Residents/Environment/Environmental-health/Pest-control/Book-a-pest-control-service.aspx">pest control page</a> to find out more.

<a name="DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_5"></a><a href="#DynamicJumpMenuManager_Top1" class="sys_backtotop">Back To Top</a><h2>Cockroaches</h2>
<p>There are two types of&nbsp;pest cockroach commonly found in the UK, the Oriental Cockroach and the German Cockroach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both are quite large and distinctive winged insects with whip like antennae&nbsp;and are easily identified.</p>
<p>Cockroaches are nocturnal, hiding during the day in places like cracks and crevices, drains, behind cupboards and fridge motor compartments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They feed on almost anything including faecal matter and often carry germs that can cause serious illness in humans especially as they often contaminate food.</p>
<p>In partnership with MITIE Pest Control we provide a service for the treatment of cockroaches for which there is a charge - visit our <a title="Book a pest control service" class="sys_0 sys_t47" href="/Residents/Environment/Environmental-health/Pest-control/Book-a-pest-control-service.aspx">pest control page</a> to find out more. If you intend to carry out your own treatment, read the label of the pesticide container and follow the instructions carefully.</p>
<p><strong>German cockroaches</strong></p>
<p>Adult German cockroaches are about 17mm long and light brown except for the shield behind the head marked with two dark stripes, which run lengthwise on the body. The nymphs are wingless and nearly black with a single light stripe running down the middle of the back. Egg capsules are light tan.</p>
<p>Egg cases are carried by the female until just before hatching and each female may produce for to six cases during her lifetime, each containing 30 to 40 eggs. Eggs hatch in 28 to 30 days, and nymphs develop in 40 to 125 days.</p>
<p>Female cockroaches live about 200 days (slightly longer than the male). The German cockroach produces more eggs and has more generations per year (three or four) than any other cockroach, and only a few individuals are needed to develop into troublesome infestations.</p>
<p>Good food hygiene is the key to avoiding cockroaches.&nbsp; Keep food and rubbish in sealed containers where possible and clean up food debris and spillages as they happen. Put all food and drink away at night, as this is when cockroaches are most active.</p>
<p>An integrated approach involving the use of cockroach traps, insecticidal gels and well targeted use of residual insecticides where appropriate is recommended. Night time inspections may be necessary in difficult to control infestation situations.</p>
<p><strong>Oriental cockroaches</strong></p>
<p>Usually dark reddish brown in colour, the adults are about 25mm long and the immature cockroaches (nymphs) resemble adults except that they are wingless.</p>
<p>Unlike other pest cockroaches, Orientals cannot climb up smooth surfaces. Oriental cockroaches generally live in moist areas, but can survive in dry areas if they have access to water. They tend to prefer cooler temperatures and thus are common in basements, boiler houses and walkways adjacent to buildings.</p>
<p>The Oriental cockroach breeds well in unventilated crawl spaces or basements where humidity is high. Adult cockroaches can live up to one year, during which females produces an average of 150 young. This cockroach prefers to feed on starchy foods but will adapt to survive.</p>
<a name="DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_6"></a><a href="#DynamicJumpMenuManager_Top1" class="sys_backtotop">Back To Top</a><h2>Mice</h2>
<p>The House Mouse is believed to have arrived in Britain around 10th Century BC. It is common in a wide range of urban and rural buildings all over the UK. Although mainly a house dweller it can commonly be found in either urban or rural areas.</p>
<p>They are rodents, brown/grey in colour with slightly lighter under parts. They have comparatively large ears, pointed snouts and long tails. An average adult mouse weighs 12-22g, with an overall length of around 165mm.</p>
<p>They must gnaw continually in order to wear down their rapidly growing incisor teeth.</p>
<p>They are good climbers, and they can swim if necessary, although they tend to avoid water.</p>
<p>They have poor eyesight, and are colour blind but they have an excellent sense of taste and acute hearing.</p>
<p>They are sexually mature at six weeks old and can produce up to 8 litters per year, with an average litter size of 4-8 young. They have a life span of between 9-12 months.</p>
<p>House mice are usually nocturnal, rodents</p>
<p>They&nbsp;<b>do not</b>&nbsp;live in sewers.</p>
<p>Mice generally prefer to eat cereals, but will sample many different foods. They do not need access to free water, as they can get any moisture they need from their food they consume.</p>
<p>They may carry a number of infectious diseases that can pose a risk to humans and animals. They can also contaminate food.</p>
<p>Preventing mice from gaining access to buildings will reduce the chances of them moving in and becoming established. Proofing buildings can be achieved by blocking openings through which mice can enter the building. Check airbricks are in place and intact (do not block them) and inspect for access points around gas, electricity and water pipes. Check that doors fit tightly.</p>
<p>Such action helps to prevent mice entering from outside and will limit their movement between properties.</p>
<p>At first sign of an infestation, contact the council on the number listed below. We will give advice or alternatively carry out a treatment for you.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the spread of the rats, high standards of refuse collection and cleanliness must be maintained.&nbsp;Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove accumulations of rubbish</li>
<li>Tidy up stored materials and locate them away from food areas&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep food in rodent proof containers and dispose of spilled food&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure that any building where food is kept is proofed against rodents by blocking any holes in walls, floors and doors and filling in gaps around entry points of services.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep vegetation around buildings short and tidy to expose any runs and burrows, thus making them more vulnerable to predators (in fact, encouraging predators, particularly cats, may provide additional protection).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite good standards of hygiene and proofing, infestations will sometimes occur. In such circumstances, it will be necessary to take action to control them. Methods of control include trapping and chemical control. Please remember that rodenticides are also poisonous to humans, livestock, pets and wildlife. Always read the product label before use and follow the label instructions.</p>
<p>Control should always be carried out together with preventative measures otherwise the underlying causes of the infestation remain and re-infestation will inevitably occur.</p>

<a name="DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_7"></a><a href="#DynamicJumpMenuManager_Top1" class="sys_backtotop">Back To Top</a><h2>Pigeons</h2>
<p>Found throughout UK the Feral (town) Pigeon is descended from the wild Rock Dove and racing pigeons.</p>
<p>Feral pigeons are found in all rural areas due the abundance of food and nesting sites. They nest all year round&nbsp;usually laying two white eggs which hatch 18 days later.&nbsp; The young leave the nest about 4-5 weeks after hatching.</p>
<p>Feral pigeons often nest in or around buildings - under eaves, bridges or anywhere else where there is shelter.&nbsp; Any form of heat source will make&nbsp;it even more attractive to them.</p>
<p>Food is the most important factor determining the size of a pigeon population and the reasonable solution to pigeon problems is to restrict food availability by using branch feeders and limiting the amount of food left on the ground.</p>
<p>Lichfield District Council seeks to reduce the population through high standards of street cleansing supported by littering and waste enforcement.</p>
<p>There are products on the market such as spike strips which physically prevent the birds landing on your property limiting the nesting and roosting sites.</p>
<p>We do not offer a service to treat pigeons.&nbsp; If you need help with a pigeon problem please look in your local directory for a competent pest control officer.</p>
<p>For more information on the control of pigeons please look at the&nbsp;<a class="sys_16" href="http://www.picasuk.com/">pigeon control advisory service website</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please note it is illegal to kill any bird, or destroy their eggs or nests, without a government licence. Don't be tempted to do it yourself.</em></p>
<a name="DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_8"></a><a href="#DynamicJumpMenuManager_Top1" class="sys_backtotop">Back To Top</a><h2>Rats</h2>
<p>First recorded in the early 18th Century the Common, Norway, Sewer or Brown Rat is found in abundance throughout the UK. More common than its relative the Black rat (Rattus rattus) the Common Rat lives in both urban and rural areas thriving off human habitation.</p>
<p>They are rodents, brownish/grey on the back and grey underneath. Their average weight is 335g and they are 300-450mm long.</p>
<p>Like all rats, they are nocturnal, although they are sometimes seen during the day. They must continually gnaw to wear down their teeth.</p>
<p>They are active burrowers, good climbers and reasonably good swimmers (often leading to confusion with water voles). They have poor eyesight and are colour blind but they have a good sense of smell and taste and acute hearing.</p>
<p>Rats are capable of reproducing at 3-4 months old, and can have 3-6 litters per year, depending upon food availability and harbourage. The litter size can be around 6-11 young, with a lifespan of between 12-19 months.</p>
<p>Their diet is extremely broad; they will eat almost anything that is edible, with a food preference for grain. They eat more meat than the Black rat, and if they get the opportunity, they will eat carrion and will prey on other animals. They can also be cannibalistic. On average, they consume 25-30g of food and drink approximately 60ml of water per day.</p>
<p>They contaminate everything they encounter with droppings, urine and hairs. They carry a wide range of diseases and parasites that are potentially harmful to humans and animals. Leptospirosis, or Weil's disease, can be fatal to humans. Other diseases, such as Toxoplasmosis and Salmonella, affect both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Rats may gain entry into a property through several ways. One route is from sewers via a defective drain. This may be prevented by ensuring that any breaks in the drain or sewers are repaired promptly. Guards can be fitted to the top of rain or vent pipes to prevent access being gained.</p>
<p>By pruning back climbing plants which grow on sides of houses to below the window-sill line and repairing structural damage.</p>
<p>Another significant problem is the considerable structural damage that can occur due to the gnawing and burrowing behaviour of these rats.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the spread of the rats, high standards of refuse collection and cleanliness must be maintained.&nbsp;Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove accumulations of rubbish</li>
<li>Tidy up stored materials and locate them away from food areas&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep food in rodent proof containers and dispose of spilled food&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ensure that any building where food is kept is proofed against rodents by blocking any holes in walls, floors and doors and filling in gaps around entry points of services.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep vegetation around buildings short and tidy to expose rat runs and burrows, thus making rats more vulnerable to predators (in fact, encouraging predators, particularly cats, may provide additional protection).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite good standards of hygiene and proofing, infestations will sometimes occur. In such circumstances, it will be necessary to take action to control the rats.</p>
<p>Methods of control include trapping and chemical control using fumigants or rodenticide baits. Please remember that rodenticides are also poisonous to humans, livestock, pets and wildlife. Always read the product label before use and follow the label instructions.</p>
<p>Control should always be carried out together with preventative measures otherwise the underlying causes of the infestation remain and re-infestation will inevitably occur.</p>

<a name="DynamicJumpMenuManager_1_Anchor_9"></a><a href="#DynamicJumpMenuManager_Top1" class="sys_backtotop">Back To Top</a><h2>Wasps</h2>
<p>The Common Wasp (Vespula vulgaris) and German Wasp (Vespula germanica) are the most common species found in the UK and are almost identical in appearance.</p>
<p>This species of invertebrate can be identified by their distinctive black and yellow banded abdomen.</p>
<p>Each year around mid-April the ready fertilised queen will emerge from hibernation; she will now search for a suitable location to start a new colony.</p>
<p>The queen will start constructing the nest from chewed bark and timber mixed with wasp saliva. Once the nest is the equivalent size of a golf or tennis ball she will lay the first eggs.</p>
<p>Wasp's nests are frequently associated with roof spaces, air grates and wall cavities of domestic housing, as well as underground and hanging from trees.</p>
<p>Nests vary in size averaging a full size football depending on the size of the colony.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer months you are less likely to be stung because the wasps are busy collecting food and bringing up the larval wasps.</p>
<p>In late summer early autumn wasps can be more aggressive as their main food source diminishes.</p>
<p>Late autumn the wasps die except for several queens who will fly off to hibernate elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nests are never used twice.</p>
<p>Annually between April and May check your property for nests; include the loft, eves, garage and shed. If you suspect a nest but can't see one in these areas take walk around you property looking for wasps going in and out of a single entrance hole every 2-4 seconds. This will indicate a nest a few inches behind this hole.</p>
<p>Wasps feed on a wide range of invertebrates including spiders, caterpillars, ants, bees, and flies. They will be attracted to sweet substances and rotting food, ensure any fallen fruit is cleared away quickly and that rubbish is not open to pests.</p>
<p>Wasps destroy many garden pests so depending on its position to sensitive areas the question should be asked whether its destruction is necessary.</p>
