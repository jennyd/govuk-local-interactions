                            <li>that there are no arrangements for anyone to receive a financial benefit from supplying alcohol, apart from any benefit to the club or to any person indirectly from the supply giving a gain from running the club </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Registered industrial and provident societies and friendly societies will qualify if the alcohol is purchased for and supplied by the club under the control of the members or a committee of members. </p>

                          <p>Please Stroud District Council in the first instance. </p>
                          <p>A failed applicant will receive notice of the refusal of an application for a certificate or variation of a certificate from the local licensing authority. </p>
                          <p>If an application is rejected, the applicant may appeal the decision. </p>

                          <h2>Licence Holder Redress</h2>
                          <p>Please Stroud District Council in the first instance. </p>
                          <p>If a local licensing authority refuses an application for a variation the licence holder may appeal the decision. A licence holder can appeal against a decision to put conditions on a certificate or to exclude any club activity. Appeals may also be made against the variation of any condition. </p>
                          <p>Appeals against the decision of a review can be made. </p>

                          <h2>Consumer Complaint</h2>
                          <p>We would always advise that in the event of a complaint the first contact is made with the trader by you - preferably in the form a letter (with proof of delivery). If that has not worked, if you are located in the UK, <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" target="external">The Citizens Advice service </a> will give you advice. From outside the UK contact the <a href="http://www.ukecc.net/" target="external">UK European Consumer Centre</a>.</p>
                          <p>A club member may request a review of the certificate. The local licensing authority will give reasons for their response to the application in a notice.</p>
                          <p>Appeals against the decision of a review can be made.</p>
                          <p>Appeals must be made to the local Magistrates' court within 21 days of the decision appealed.</p>

                          <p>Any interested party may make representations to the local licensing authority before the certificate is granted or before amendments to a certificate are granted. If representations are made a hearing will be held to consider the application and the representations. Notices will be made by the local licensing authority detailing the reasons for any outcome. Interested parties who made representations will receive notice of a failed application.</p>
                          <p>An interested party is:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>a person living near the premises or a body representing such a person</li>

                          </ul>
                          <p>An interested party may request a review of the club premises certificate. The local licensing authority will give reasons for their response to the application in a notice.</p>
                          <p>An interested party may appeal if they argue that a certificate should not have been granted or that different or additional conditions or limitations on activities should have been made. They may also appeal against any variation of a condition.</p>
                          <p>Appeals against the decision of a review can be made.</p>
                          <p>Appeals must be made to the local Magistrates' court within 21 days of the decision appealed.</p>

                <p>Note that in addition to a full inspection prior to the granting of a new licence or a renewal, licensed premises will also be subject to unannounced inspections to ensure that the licence conditions are being met and that the welfare of the animals being used for breeding under the licence is secured. </p>
                <p>Licences must be renewed annually while the breeding operation continues and we would recommend that applications for renewal are made in good time to ensure that we can be satisfied that new licences can and should be granted and issued prior to the expiry of the existing one. </p>

                  <h2>Licence Summary</h2>
                  <p>To collect money or sell articles for the benefit of charitable or other purposes in a public place in England or Wales, you require a Street Collection Permit from your local council. A 'public place' is a place where the public has access.</p>
                  <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
                  <p>No provision in the legislation</p>
                  <h2>Regulation </h2>
                  <p> The power to regulate street collections and issue licences is contained in the <a class="normal" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/6-7/31">Police, Factories, &amp; c. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1916 (c.31) </a> </p>
                  <h2>Application Evaluation Process</h2>
                  <p>Before applying for a permit in Stroud District you may wish to call or email The Licensing Section at Stroud District Council to check that the date(s) you are requesting have not already been booked by another charity. It is in the interest of the public and collectors that there are not too many collections taking place at the same time at the same location. </p>
                  <p>An application form should be submitted to the Local Authority detailing the location and dates of the proposed collection. There is no fee for this permit. </p>
                  <p>Direct Debit Collections do not need a permit, but the dates must be confirmed with this office first. </p>
                  <p>The purpose of the legal requirement to obtain consent is to ensure collectors are properly authorised and that money is collected in a secure way and the total proceeds collected are properly accounted for. </p>
                  A return form must be completed following the collection and returned to the local authority.
                  <h2>Will Tacit Consent Apply?</h2>
                  <p>Yes. This means that providing your application is valid you will be able to act as though your application is granted if you have not heard from the local authority by the end of the target completion period of 30 days. </p>
                  Tacit consent will only apply for applications that are submitted electronically via the Point of Single Contact (PSC) or when the business can show proof of delivery from a post office, a recognised courier or an Officer of Stroud District Council.

                          <h2>How to Make an Application and the Evaluation Process </h2>
                          <p>The TEN must be given in writing, in duplicate, to the Local Licensing Authority at least ten clear working days before the event. A fee (see below) is payable with the TEN. Alternatively the TEN can be submitted online through Business Link using the link below. The Licensing authority for Stroud District is Stroud District Council. </p>
                          <p>If the permitted limits in the regulations are exceeded the TEN will be invalid and Stroud District Council will issue a Notice to you no later than 24 hours before the beginning of the event period. If a Notice is issued the licensable activities at the event cannot go ahead. If you are unsure as to how many TENs have been given so far in the current calendar year please contact the Licensing Section at Stroud District Council. </p>
                          <p>Stroud District Council will acknowledge receipt of a valid TEN before the end of the first working day following the day the TEN was received or before the end of the second working day following the day on which it was received if the day the TEN was received is not a working day. </p>
                          <p>You must also give a copy of the TEN to the Chief Officer of the local Police no later than 10 working days before the event period. If you apply online through Business Link, Stroud District Council will forward a copy of the TEN to the police on your behalf. </p>
                          <p>If the Chief Police Officer who receives the TEN believes that the event would undermine crime prevention objectives then he/she can serve an Objection Notice on Stroud District Council and you as the Premises User. This notice must be served within 2 working days of receipt by the Police of the TEN. </p>
                          <p>Stroud District Council must hold a Hearing if an Objection Notice is served by the Police. They may then issue a Counter Notice to you if they consider it necessary for the promotion of crime prevention objective. A decision must be made at least 24 hours before the beginning of the event. If a Counter Notice is issued the licensable activities at the event cannot go ahead </p>
                          A Police Chief Officer may modify the TEN with the consent of the Premises User. In such a case an Objection Notice will be deemed to have been withdrawn.


                        <h2>Will Tacit Consent Apply?</h2>
                        <p>Yes. If your TEN is valid you will be able to act as though your TEN is accepted if you have not heard from the local authority by the end of the target completion period. </p>
                        If a Police Objection Notice is made within 48 hours of a valid TEN being received by the Police a public Hearing must be held to determine the TEN.&nbsp;

                    <li>any other person whose representations might show grounds on which the authority has a power or duty to refuse to grant a licence</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Before granting or refusing to grant the licence, the local authority shall consider any inspectors' reports based on their inspection of the zoo, consult the applicant about any conditions they propose should be attached to the licence and make arrangements for an inspection to be carried out. At least 28 days notice of the inspection shall be provided by the local authority.</p>
                  <p>The local authority will not grant the licence if they feel that the zoo would adversely affect the health or safety of people living in near it, or seriously affect the preservation of law and order or if they are not satisfied that appropriate conservation measures would be satisfactorily implemented.</p>
                  <p>An application may also be refused if:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>the local authority are not satisfied that accommodation, staffing or management standards are suitable for the proper care and wellbeing of the animals or for the proper conduct of the zoo</li>
                    <li>the applicant, or if the applicant is an incorporated company, the company or any of the company's directors, managers, secretaries or other similar officers, or a keeper in the zoo, has been convicted of any offence involving the ill-treatment of animals</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Applications to renew a licence will be considered no later than six months before the expiry of the existing licence, unless a shorter time period is allowed by the local authority.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary of State, after consulting the local authority, may direct them to attach one or more conditions to a licence.</p>
                  <p>The local authority may advise the Secretary of State that, because of the small number of animals kept in the zoo or the small number of the kinds of animal kept there, a direction should be made that that a licence is not required.</p>
                  <h2>Will Tacit Consent Apply?</h2>
                  <p>No. It is in the public interest that the authority must process your application before it can be granted. If you have not heard from the local authority within a reasonable period, please contact us. </p>
