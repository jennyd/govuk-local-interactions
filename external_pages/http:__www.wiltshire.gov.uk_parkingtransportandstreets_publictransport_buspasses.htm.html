		<h2>Renewing your Wiltshire Bus Pass</h2>
<p>If your Wiltshire Bus Pass expires soon it will be renewed automatically unless we need further information, such as current evidence of your disability or confirmation of your address. Most people will automatically receive a letter enclosing the new bus pass, which you should start to use immediately. If you have not heard from us by seven working days before the expiry date of your existing pass, then please contact us. </p>
<p>If you have received a renewal form then we need some information from you before we can renew the bus pass. Please return the renewal form to us as soon as you can with the information it asks for. If you have moved in the last few years and have not yet told us please contact us so we can send to your new address.</p>

<h2><a name="Bus_Passes-Qualify-Anchor"></a>Who qualifies for a bus pass?</h2>
<ul><li>People whose sole or primary residence is Wiltshire <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>Who have reached the qualifying age <strong>or</strong> </li>
<li>Are disabled for any of the qualifying reasons shown below</li></ul>
<p>Are you looking for <a href="schoolseducationandlearning/schoolsandcolleges/schoolstransport.htm">school and college bus passes</a>?</p>
<h3>What is my qualifying age?</h3>
<ul><li>If you were born on or before 5 April 1950 your qualifying age is 60.</li>
<li>If you are born after 5 April 1950 the age of eligibility for concessionary travel in England will be linked to the state pensionable age applying to women.</li>
<li>The state pensionable age for men and women will have harmonised at 65 by 2020. Beyond 2020 the age of eligibility for concessionary travel will continue to increase in line with any future changes to the state pension age.</li></ul>
<p>Calculate the date of your state pension age</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension">Calculate the date of your state pension age</a></li></ul>
<p>Alternatively contact us and we will check for you.</p>
<h3>Do I qualify because of my disability?</h3>
<p>You qualify if you are within one of the seven categories listed in the Transport Act 2000, as shown below:</p>
<ul><li>Is blind or partially sighted</li>
<li>Is profoundly or severely deaf</li>
<li>Is without speech</li>
<li>Has a disability, or has suffered an injury, that has a substantial or long-term effect on his ability to walk</li>
<li>Does not have arms or has long-term loss of use of both arms</li>
<li>Has a learning disability, that is, a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning</li>
<li>Would, if they applied for the grant of a licence to drive a motor vehicle under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 have their application refused on the grounds of medical fitness. Examples of those who are currently barred are people with, epilepsy, severe mental disorder and liability to sudden attacks of giddiness or fainting</li></ul>
<p>The disability should be permanent or have lasted at least 12 months, be likely to last 12 months or be likely to recur, and should have a substantial effect on the person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.</p>
<h2><a name="Bus_Passes-Options-Anchor"></a>What pass options are available?</h2>
<p>The scheme offers three options for getting help with the cost of transport, which will differ depending on your eligibility. You can only choose ONE option.</p>
<h3>Option 1 &#8211; bus pass</h3>
<p>The bus pass provides the pass holder with free off peak travel on local bus services anywhere in England between the hours of 9.30am and 11pm Monday to Friday and all day at weekends and bank holidays. Additionally in Wiltshire it gives free travel on buses after 11pm, where these operate. Also on certain infrequent bus services it can be used from an earlier time than 9.30am:</p>
<p><a href="./buses-concessionary-bus-passes-used-before-0930.pdf" target="_blank" class="document" title="Buses on which concessionary passes can be used before 9.30am"><img src="pdf.gif" alt="PDF" height="10" width="10" />Buses on which concessionary passes can be used before 9.30am <span class="synopsis">Buses on which concessionary passes can be used before 9.30am</span><span class="filesize"> 14kb</span></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>It can be used on all Connect2Wiltshire services and will give either free travel or a cheaper fare, depending on the service. Ask for details when you book (08456 525 255). It can also be used on the Salisbury Park and Ride buses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bus pass does not cover long distance coach services like National Express and in Swindon it only provides free off peak free travel as in other parts of England. </p>
<h3>Option 2 &#8211; bus pass plus companion</h3>
<p>This is only issued where a person cannot travel unaided due to a disability. It offers the holder the same free national travel as the bus pass but in addition it allows a companion to travel accompanying the pass holder free of charge in Wiltshire and the adjoining authorities with whom we have a reciprocal agreement. Currently these are Swindon, Hampshire, Dorset, Somerset, Bath &amp; North East Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Bristol and North Somerset.</p>
<p>See how to apply below for evidence to be supplied to qualify for this pass.</p>
<h3>Option 3 &#8211; taxi vouchers</h3>
<p>As an alternative to the Wiltshire Bus Pass, Taxi vouchers to the value of &#163;40 for the full year can be claimed by those people who use a wheelchair for most of their day-to-day activities and expect this to continue permanently</p>
<p>People who choose taxi vouchers will not be able to change their travel concession until invitation to renew, the following April.</p>
<p>On first application a reduced value of vouchers may be issued for the part-year as follows: 1 July to 30 September - &#163;30, 1 October to 31 December - &#163;20, 1 January to 31 March - &#163;10.</p>

Please write your name and post code on the back of the photo.</p>
<h3>What must I include with my application form?</h3>

<ul><li>Disability Living Allowance letter showing the mobility component and eligibility dates.</li>

Please send a copy of your &#8220;Reason for Decision&#8221; letter from the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency so that we can assess your eligibility.</p>
<p>If you are unable to provide evidence as above we may consider an explanation of how you qualify under the seven categories mentioned previously from a doctor, consultant or other qualified health professional.

<p></p>
