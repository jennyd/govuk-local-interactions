Some find themselves in trouble and some will have lived through very unhappy experiences at home. They can be difficult to engage with and their backgrounds may make them vulnerable to drug use or criminal behaviour. You’ll need to cope with mood swings and angry outbursts and have to negotiate rules and boundaries. You need to be patient and resilient to get past their tough exterior.</p><p><a
href="https://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/fostering#teenagefostering">Foster a teenager &#8211; view more information&#8230;</a></p><p>Do you have experience caring for young people with challenging behaviours? If yes please have a look at our <a
href="https://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/fostering#soloplacement">Solo placement scheme</a> details are below.</p></div><p>Foster carers in Warwickshire are an essential part of the service we provide to children, young people and their families. The contribution made by all our foster carers is greatly valued and appreciated.</p><p>We believe that every child has the right to family life. Fostering provides a positive alternative for a child until they can return home.</p><div

The age of the child you may care for will depend on your own experience, skills and preference as well as on the ages of any children you may have.</p><p>We are currently recruiting for foster carers who are interested in caring for:</p><ul><li>teenagers</li><li>a parent and their child</li><li>children aged over 8 on a permanent basis</li><li>brothers and sisters, particularly children aged 0-5 years</li><li>children and young people from Black and Asian backgrounds</li></ul><p>We are also keen to hear from people who already have experience as a foster carer, whether that’s from fostering for a local authority or an independent foster agency.</p><div

Just like the children and young people we look after, foster carers in Warwickshire come from all parts of the community.</p><p>We need people from all walks of life so that we can find the best match for every child.</p><p>You can be considered for fostering if you are:</p><ul><li>single &#8211; male or female</li><li>from any ethnic background</li><li>families with or without children, married or living with a partner</li><li>a person with a disability</li><li>couples of the same or different gender</li></ul><p>What matters most is that you have the time and space, commitment and patience, alongside the care and skills to work with children and their parents.</p><p>Foster carers for Warwickshire need a spare bedroom to accommodate children and young people.</p><p><em>If you have any questions about your suitability to foster for Warwickshire not covered on this page, please give us a call on 0800 408 1556.</em></p><h4>What is the difference between adoption and fostering?</h4><ul><li>Adoption is taking on the role of the parent for the child permanently and transfers all rights and responsibilities from the original parent or parents;</li><li>Fostering is caring for children either short term or long term where the parents and local authority retain the rights and responsibilities for the child.</li></ul><h4>I have no experience of caring for children</h4><p>Ideally, you should have some experience of caring for children either through caring for our own children, work experience or caring for children of friends or relatives. If you don&#8217;t have any experience with children, please call us to discuss.</p><h4>I do not live in Warwickshire</h4><p>We are happy to accept enquiries from people who live close to the Warwickshire border, but you will need to be able to transport children to school and contact sessions within Warwickshire and attend meetings and training at offices and venues within Warwickshire.</p><h4>I live in a rented property</h4><p>If you live in a rented property we expect you to have:</p><ul><li>A secure tenancy;</li><li>Have a tenancy agreement which states that you have to be given a minimum of two months notice to leave the property by your landlord;</li><li>If you have a tenancy agreement we will ask to see a copy during the assessment process.</li></ul><h4>I am employed, full or part time.</h4><p>Foster carers for Warwickshire can work, but need to be available at key times of the day for children:</p><ul><li>Foster carers for school aged children need to be available before and after school and during school holidays;</li><li>Foster carers for pre-school aged children need to have one carer at home full time;</li><li>You also need to consider whether you can be flexible with your working hours to attend meetings in relation to the child and care for a child if they are ill or out of school.</li></ul><h4>Someone in my household has a criminal record</h4><p>We try and get a balanced picture of where people are now in their lives. Minor offences committed some time ago may not exclude you from fostering although serious offences including violence or offences against children will. Talk in confidence to a member of the fostering team if you have any concerns about this.</p><p>All members of a household aged 18 and over have to have a Disclosure and Barring Services check and any offences will be considered as part of the assessment of the household&#8217;s suitability to foster.</p><h4>Someone in my household smokes</h4><p>We will not approve any household where any member of the household smokes in or outside of the house. This includes the adult children of Prospective Foster Carers and lodgers. Therefore if a member of your household smokes they would need to be willing to give up before we could consider an application.</p><h4>Will the child continue to go to their own school or attend a school within my community?</h4><p>Children placed permanently may transfer to a school within your community. Children placed short-term may continue to attend their regular school with their friends.</p><h4>Will I meet the child&#8217;s parents or other family members?</h4><p>Most children benefit from contact with their parents or other family members. The frequency and arrangements for supervision of this will vary. Contact can also take place by phone or letter.</p><p></div></div></p><p><div

Being a teenager is a difficult time for anyone, and teenagers in foster care come with their own particular challenges. Some find themselves in trouble and some will have lived through very unhappy experiences at home. They can be difficult to engage with and their backgrounds may make them vulnerable to drug use or criminal behaviour. You&#8217;ll need to cope with mood swings and angry outbursts and have to negotiate rules and boundaries. You need to be patient and resilient to get past their tough exterior.</p><p>Planning to leave home can be a terrifying as well as an exciting event for anyone. Most of us are grateful for the help of our families at this time. But who’s there for 13–18 year olds who don’t have the support of families of their own?</p><p>Without help, too many of these young people can find it hard to obtain jobs or accommodation. As a result they can suffer from all kinds of problems and may face a life on benefits or even homelessness.</p><h4>When caring for a teenager you will be required to:</h4><ul><li>Show you have the commitment and ability to really listen to and accept a young person for who they really are;</li><li>Support a young person to prepare them for independence by helping them to develop their practical skills such as cooking and budgeting, and also encourage and support them to access education and training opportunities;</li><li>Offer a safe and caring environment for a young person and to help them maintain a relationship with their family;</li><li>Have a sense of humour; caring for a teenager can be a frustrating and challenging experience, but equally have it rewards.</li></ul><h4>What will you receive in return?</h4><ul><li>Excellent training and an opportunity to undertake a QCF Diploma for the Children&#8217;s Workforce after a qualifying period;</li><li>Generous financial support, carers opting to care for teenagers will immediately be awarded the additional<br

/></h3><div
class="accordion-slide-content"></p><h4>What is the Solo Placement Fostering Scheme?</h4><p>The solo placement fostering scheme is a pilot scheme that will enable some young to return to live within a family environment, in Warwickshire. These young people are currently living in residential care which is often miles away from their family and friends in Warwickshire. We want to support Warwickshire young people to live in Warwickshire, cared for by Warwickshire carers.</p><p>These young people, by virtue of their backgrounds have much higher needs than their peers who are currently cared for by Warwickshire in foster homes. They are likely to have had previous multiple placement breakdowns, been traumatised by previous experiences of abuse and neglect, and have associated emotional, behavioural and attachment difficulties.</p><p>This scheme is different from mainstream fostering for the following reasons;</p><ul><li>Each foster carer will be approved for only one placement;</li><li>As a carer household you will not be caring for any other children;</li><li>There will be a careful matching process which will begin towards the end of the assessment process;</li><li>Introductions will be at the child’s pace, in recognition of the move from residential care to a foster family;</li><li>There will be a bespoke support package involving health and education to enable you to meet the needs of the young person;</li></ul><hr
/><h4>Solo Placement Scheme Foster Carer Key Responsibilities</h4><p>Warwickshire is committed to giving all children and young people the opportunity for family life wherever this is possible. As a foster carer providing a solo placement you will provide professional specialist placements for specific children and young people we are seeking to support in returning to the community from residential care.</p><p>We require at least one foster carer within a household to be at home as a full time carer with no other employment. You will need to be committed to attend meetings and to work in partnership with a range of other professionals as a significant member of a team around the young person. In addition you will be required to attend on-going professional training and development courses and support groups.</p><p>The children or young people you will care for will have very specific or complex needs which may initially require a higher level of attention and supervision. They are amongst the most vulnerable and demanding and would not be able to be placed alongside other children.</p><p>Children with complex needs may display the following:</p><ul><li>self-harm;</li><li>sexualised behaviour;</li><li>social or attachment disorders or mental health difficulties;</li><li>criminal activity;</li><li>physical or aggressive behaviour;</li></ul><p>Ideally carers for this scheme will have no children of their own under 18 living at home but we may consider households with younger teenagers in individual circumstances.</p><p>You will need:</p><ul><li>significant experience of working directly with or caring for challenging young people who present a wide range of behaviours;</li><li>to be open-minded and have the commitment to make a difference to a young person’s life;</li><li>patience, time and commitment to meet the individual needs of the child.</li></ul><p>Ultimately you must be able to provide stability and support, communicating with the young person to build a positive relationship to bring about long term change.</p><h4>What will you receive in return?</h4><p>You will be paid a weekly fee of £558.94 and fostering allowances and you will have the support of a dedicated fostering social worker and social care worker.</p><p>You will have the support of a team of professionals who are working with the young person in your care and who can offer you one to one advice and support if needed.</p><p>You will have access to a specialist training programme, some of which will commence during your assessment period.</p><p>You will have access to 24 hour support when the offices are closed via the foster care support line and Emergency Duty Team.</p><h4>Next Steps</h4><p>Do you have the experience, family set up and commitment described above to make a difference to a young persons life?

class="accordion-slide-content"></p><h4>Caring for a parent with their child</h4><p>Warwickshire Fostering Service is keen to find foster placements for new parents and their children needing support for a few months. Parents, particularly young mothers, who are unable to meet their child’s most basic needs and protect them, sometimes need a nurturing family environment where they can be supported in looking after their baby or young child.</p><p>Parent and child foster placements may help a family to stay together and provide a positive alternative to residential care, which can be expensive and isolating. Potential foster carers provide both practical and emotional support to help the parent to develop the skills required to meet their own and their child’s needs. Once the parent has successfully completed an assessment within their fostering placement, they are then supported to live independently with their child.</p><p>As a parent and child assessment foster carer you will offer a time limited 12 week placement where Care Proceedings are in place in respect of the child and, an assessment of parenting ability is needed for Court purposes. The parent could be mother, father or both. Additionally the parent may be under or over the age of 18 years. Where parents are under the age of 18 years they may also be Looked After in their own right.</p><p>Your primary role will be as part of a team that assesses and gathers evidence for whether or not the child needs to be removed from their parent(s) permanently.</p><p>During the assessment process you may also be required to model good parenting and offer advice and guidance on identified tasks to the parent which will have been outlined as part of Placement Planning.</p><p>These arrangements will require a high level of attention and supervision, in view of this Carers for this project will have no other children under 10 years old living in the home.</p><h4>Parent and Child Foster Carer Key Responsibilities/Criteria include:</h4><ul><li>The primary carer will need to be at home and not working.</li><li>There can be no children younger than 10 years old living in the home alongside the Parent and Child Arrangement</li><li>The foster carers will need adequate accommodation for the parent and child to have their own room or share a room (as appropriate) but also be able to accommodate the child in the carers bedroom where safeguarding requires this.</li><li>To work to Child Protection Plans and Care Plans as outlined for the Court.</li><li>To work as part of a multi-agency team including health, education and specialist support services.</li></ul><h4>What will you receive in return?</h4><ul><li>We recognise the need for you to be at home full time therefore we will pay you a weekly fee of £512.40 plus other relevant Looked After Allowances.

Respite foster carers offer families and other foster carers periods of short stay respite care. Respite can make it possible for children to stay with their family or main carer, reducing tension and overcoming difficulties.</p><p>You will need to feel confident about working with a range of children and young people and their families who are from a range of backgrounds.</p><p>You will need to be happy to care for teenagers and have a high level of availability to care for children during school holidays, weekends and at other times. Respite can be considered alongside other types of fostering.</p><p>We are currently recruiting Family Link carers to provide regular short breaks to children with disabilities, including children with learning difficulties, autism and physical disabilities. This gives new experiences and new friends to children, whilst for their parents it means some extra time for themselves and for any other children in the family.</p><p>Family Link carers come from all age groups and all walks of life and you don’t have to have previous experience of disability. All you need is to be able to offer a child somewhere to stay overnight. Family Link carers are recruited and approved in the same way as other foster carers. Once approved, family link carers are carefully matched up with a child who is gradually introduced for them. If this goes well, carers and family agree a pattern of visits, perhaps an overnight stay every two or three weeks or a weekend a month.  Prospective Family Link Carers need to be able to commit to care for a child one weekend a month and be open on the range range of child they could care for.</p><h4>Next Steps</h4><p>This information is the start; if you are still interested and would like to talk to a Social Worker please contact the Fostering Recruitment Team:</p><ul><li><a

In addition to the fostering schemes described the service is also looking for supported lodgings carers. The expectations of these carers are different from foster carers as they care for young people aged 18 and over. Further information is available if you wish to take your enquiry further.</p><p>The young person should be provided with a room of their own and live as part of the household having access to all communal areas including kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities. They may be provided with a front door key. The room should be equipped with bed and wardrobe or storage space for clothes.</p><p>Many practical details of each placement will vary according to the young person’s needs. These details will be set out in an Individual Agreement negotiated before the start of the placement. They include the roles and responsibilities of carer and young person with regard to meals, laundry, use of telephone etc.</p><p>The sorts of tasks Supported Lodgings Carers provide include:</p><ul><li>some budgeting help;</li><li>Initial help with cooking and meal preparation;</li><li>help with jobs or College Applications;</li><li>moral support to stick at it!</li></ul><p>Reference checks will be made as standard for supported lodgings carer and training is available in issues relevant to this type of care.</p><p>Supported Lodgings Carers will receive a guaranteed payment of £140 per week. This will be made up differently from various monies according to the circumstances of the young person. E.g. housing benefit, wages where received and a variable amount from Social Services to meet the guaranteed sum. Young People in supported lodgings placements are expected to manage their own finances (eventually!) and so receive their own personal allowances from the Local Authority.</p><h4>Next Steps</h4><p>This information is the start; if you are still interested and would like to talk to a Social Worker please contact the Fostering Recruitment Team:</p><ul><li><a

id="fostering-11" class="fostering-home">How do I become a foster carer?</span></h3><div
class="accordion-slide-content"></p><h4>What happens next</h4><p>First of all, you will need to consider carefully which of the foster care schemes most suits you and whether you feel you have the skills, experience and commitment required to become a foster carer.</p><p>If you would like to find out more:</p><ul><li><a
href="//www.warwickshire.gov.uk/fosteringrequest">Register your interest in fostering online</a>; or</li><li>Call FREEPHONE FOSTERING 0800 408 1556</li></ul><p>When we have received your online form or you have contacted us by telephone, we will send you a brochure containing information on fostering in Warwickshire. If after considering this information you are still interested please return the postcard in the brochure or call us on 0800 408 1556 and we will telephone you to gather information and discuss your interest in fostering and assess your suitability.</p><p>During this call we will give you more details about the different types of fostering. Following this phone call we will send you a further information pack including a form to request a home visit. The further information pack will tell you about the skills you need to become a carer, the tasks involved in caring for a child and the support and training you will receive when you foster for Warwickshire.</p><p>This home visit provides you with an opportunity to discuss your own personal circumstances and to reach a decision with the social worker on whether or not you wish to continue with the first stage of your application. We will also tell you about the assessment process to become a carer.</p><h4>References</h4><p>In order to proceed further you will need to give your consent for us to take up references. These will be in the form of three personal references (a family member and two friends who have known you for three years or more).</p><p>We will also take up statutory references from the DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service); Children&#8217;s Services (previously social services); probation; health trust; and your GP.</p><p>The DBS references are important and help us to identify anyone who may have serious offences particularly in relation to children. It is most important that we ensure that all children are protected and safe from harm.</p><p>We will also need to take up references from any ex-partners with whom you have cohabited in the past.</p><p>All references need to be satisfactory. They form an important part of your application and you will need to consider these carefully.</p><h4>Focus on Fostering courses</h4><p>While the references are being taken up you will be invited to attend a short course called &#8220;Focus on Fostering&#8221;. This course offers you an opportunity to learn more about fostering.</p><p>The courses are run locally and are offered at weekends and occasionally in the evenings. The course comprises a total of four sessions and each applicant will need to attend. The course contributes towards your assessment.</p><h4>Assessment</h4><p>Once you have completed the &#8216;Focus on Fostering&#8217; course, a social worker will make arrangements to begin your assessment.</p><p>You and your family will be visited at home and you will be required to provide evidence of your suitability to foster in line with national fostering standards.</p><p>You will be guided through this process by the assessing social worker who will write a detailed report about your application to foster.</p><p>You will see the final report and sign it and have an opportunity to make your own comments.</p><h4>Approval</h4><p>When your assessment is completed it is presented to the Fostering Panel which you will be invited to attend. The Panel reviews and approves Warwickshire foster carers. Once approved you are then officially a foster carer for Warwickshire County Council.</p><h4>How long does it take to be approved?</h4><p>The time the initial process takes can vary, but we aim for the time the assessment takes to be 6 months from the date you commence the &#8216;Focus on Fostering&#8217; training course.</p><p></div></div></p><p><a
