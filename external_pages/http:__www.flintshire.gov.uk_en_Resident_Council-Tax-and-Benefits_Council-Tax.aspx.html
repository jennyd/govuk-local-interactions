<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/">Your Council Tax Bill</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>Council Tax is a locally set tax that is payable on all domestic properties. &nbsp;Your Council Tax is made up three separate charges or precepts,&nbsp;based on the property valuation band that your property has been placed in.</p>
<p>The separate charges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flintshire County Council</li>
<li>Police and Crime Commissioner North Wales</li>
<li>Your local Town or Community Council</li>
</ul>
<p>Flintshire County Council collects all of these charges which are then paid to each of the organisations.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/">Who has to pay?</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p>Council tax is charged on most homes whether it is a house, bungalow, flat, maisonette or mobile home and whether it is owned or rented. &nbsp;Usually one person, called the liable person, has to pay the council tax. Nobody under the age of 18 can be a liable person. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Couples living together will both be liable, even if there is only one name on the bill. &nbsp;This applies whether the couple is married, living together or in a civil partnership. &nbsp;If one partner is a full time student or is severely mentally impaired, they will not be liable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is usually the person living in a property that will be the liable person. &nbsp;We have to decide who has to pay council tax for each property before we issue a bill.</p>
<p>People who live in a property as their main residence have to pay the council tax for that property. &nbsp;We treat you as a resident if you are 18 years old or over and live in a property as your main residence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If more than one person lives in a property, we use a system called the &lsquo;Hierarchy of Liability&rsquo; to work out who has to pay the council tax. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The person nearest to the top of the hierarchy is the person who has to pay. &nbsp;Two people at the same point of the hierarchy have the same responsibility to pay unless one of them is a full time student or is severely mentally impaired. If no one lives in the property then the owner has to pay the council tax. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The hierarchy of liability is:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>A resident who owns the freehold</li>
<li>A resident who owns the leasehold</li>
<li>A resident who is an assured tenant or is a statutory or secure tenant</li>
<li>A resident who is a licensee. This means that they are not a tenant but have permission to stay there</li>
<li>Any resident, for example, a squatter</li>
<li>An owner of the property who does not live there &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some properties where the owner, rather than the residents, will be responsible for payment. The hierarchy of liability does not apply to these properties.</p>
<p>The owner will be liable if: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Houses in multiple occupation, that is where the residents do not form a single household and pay their rent separately for different parts of the property. The tenants will usually have separate tenancy agreements.</li>
<li>Residential care or nursing homes, and some types of hostels which provide care</li>
<li>Homes occupied by Religious communities</li>
<li>Homes which are occasionally occupied by the owner and whose domestic staff are also resident</li>
<li>Properties occupied by ministers of religion, as a residence from which the ministers duties of office are carried out</li>
<li>Properties provided to asylum seekers</li>
</ul>
<p>What if I think I don't have to pay council tax? If you don't think you have to pay council tax, you should <a title="Council Tax Team contact details" class="sys_16" href="mailto:local.taxation@flintshire.gov.uk">contact us</a> first. &nbsp;If you are not happy with our response, you can appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.</p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/">E-billing service</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content">
<p><strong>What is e-billing?</strong></p>
<p>E-billing is the new way to receive your Council Tax bill. Instead of getting a traditional paper bill we will send your bill by e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of e-billing?</strong></p>
<p>E-billing will provide a faster, more efficient and convenient way to receive and check your bills. Here are some of the advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can view your bill as soon as it is available and keep a copy on file.</li>
<li>You still have the choice to download and print your bill.</li>
<li>You can redistribute copies of bills quickly and electronically.</li>
<li>Each person named on the bill can receive their own copy at the e-mail address given for each person.</li>
<li>Bills are issued direct to the intended recipient and are not delayed by post.</li>
<li>It helps the Council to reduce printing and postage costs.</li>
<li>It helps protect the environment by saving paper.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do I register for e-billing?</strong></p>
<p>To register to receive e-bills, simply complete the short application form below.</p>

<h4>What can I use the system for?</h4>
<p>Once you have regiestered and received your username and passwork, you will be able to use this service to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check when your next payment is due</li>
<li>See the value of any discounts that you are getting</li>
<li>Make payments online</li>
<li>Tell us about any changes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it secure?</h4>
<p>Yes, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. To ensure that no-body can read the information you send us we have taken the following measures:</p>
<h4>Encryption technology</h4>
<p>Our secure server software encrypts all your personal information. Encryption means taking original data (e.g. your username, customer account number and account details) and converting into coded data so that it is unrecognisable as it travels across the Internet.</p>
<p>When you enter the secure area of our website you will see a padlock icon appear in your browser window. You can click on the padlock to be sure that it is Flintshire County Council you are trusting.</p>
<h4>Data Protection</h4>
<p>We comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 which ensures the protection and care of personal information.

<h4>How do I check my Council Tax Band?</h4>
<p><a title="Llink to www.voa.gov.uk will open in a new window" class="sys_16" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/cti/InitS.asp?lcn=0">Search the VOA website (new window)</a></p>
<h4>How is my property valued?</h4>
<p>The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is responsible for valuing all properties in England and Wales and placing your property in one of nine property bands. The VOA is an independent Agency and not part of the Council. From the 1st April 2005, all properties in Wales have been re-valued. The VOA calculate your property band based on property prices on the 1st April 2003. This is known as the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo;. The set date ensures that all properties are assessed as at a fixed point in time, ensuring a fairer system for everyone. The VOA takes account of the size, age, character and locality of your property and sales data from around the valuation date to arrive at the correct valuation band. If your property has built after the 1st April 2003 the VOA will band your property according to what the value would have been on that date using comparable sales data to do this.</p>
<h4>What are the Valuation Bands?</h4>
<p>Each band has a range of property values. The amount of Council Tax that you pay depends on the Valuation band of the property you live in and the community in which the property is located.</p>
How do I find out How much I should pay?
<p>If you would like to know how much Council Tax is due for a property that you live in please <a title="Will create an e-mail" class="sys_16" href="mailto:local.taxation@flintshire.gov.uk">send an e-mail</a>, remembering to let us know the address of the property. We will then send you an e-mail to let you know what the latest Council Tax charges are for the current financial year. We will assume that there are two people living in the property and that you are not entitled to discounts. The property bands and values for Wales are shown in the <a title="Your guide to Council Tax - 2015/16" class="sys_21" href="/en/PDFFiles/Council-Tax/Your-guide-to-Council-Tax-201516.pdf">Council Tax Guide</a> (pdf opens in new window).</p>

<div class="sys_acc_content">When we work out Council Tax, we assume that two people aged 18 or over, live in most properties. Some people are &lsquo;disregarded&rsquo; for Council Tax purposes. This means that we will not count them for Council Tax purposes when we decide how many people, aged 18 or over, live in your property. For example if there are two adults in a property and one of them is a disregarded person the council tax charge is calculated as if only one adult is living in the property and a 25% discount would apply.

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/">Enforcement agents</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content"><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The Council can instruct an Enforcement Agent to collect outstanding Council Tax debt from you if a liability order has been issued in your name. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">We will do this either if you have not made, or not kept to an agreed repayment plan, or you have not completed and returned the personal information form sent to you. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The Enforcement Agent will contact you to arrange payment either in full or by instalments. You must answer his letters, emails or calls and arrange payment. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">If your debt has been passed to an Enforcement Agent you will incur </span><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">a fixed fee of </span><strong style="line-height: 1.7em;">&pound;75 for each liability order</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.7em;">when they issue a letter to you by post. </span><br /><strong>Any payments or offers of repayment should then be made to the </strong><a title="Debt Enforcement" class="sys_0 sys_t379" href="/en/Resident/Debt-Enforcement/Debt-Enforcement.aspx"><strong>Debt Enforcem</strong><strong>ent Section</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.7em;">Enforcement visit</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">If you do not arrange to pay the Enforcement Agents, or arrange to make payment and then do not pay as agreed they will visit you. If they visit there is </span><span style="line-height: 1.7em;"></span><strong style="line-height: 1.7em;">a fixed fee of &pound;235 plus 7.5% for any balance due above &pound;1500.</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The Enforcement Agent will normally ask you for payment in full, however if you cannot meet this request, the Enforcement Agent will normally make a repayment arrangement with you. The Enforcement Agent may enter into a Controlled Goods Agreement, where the agent makes a list of your possessions that is equal in value to your debt. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">If your possessions are subject to a Controlled Goods Agreement you cannot dispose or sell them without the Enforcement Agents permission. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">If you do not sign the Controlled Goods Agreement the Enforcement Agent can take your goods whilst he is at your property. There are additional costs of </span><strong style="line-height: 1.7em;">&pound;110 plus 7.5% for any balance due above &pound;1500</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.7em;">if goods have to be removed and sold. </span><br />
<p>If you do not pay as agreed and you have signed a Controlled Goods Agreement, the Enforcement Agent may enter your property, by force if necessary, to take the goods listed.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">If the Enforcement Agent believes that there are insufficient items to clear the debt, we will then consider other recovery options such as bankruptcy, a charging order against your property, or applying for committal to prison.&nbsp; </span><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2><a class="sys_acc_button" href="/">Completion Notices</a></h2>
<div class="sys_acc_content"><span style="line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>Why have I received this completion notice?</strong> </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The Council considers that, for council tax purposes, your property has either reached a stage of substantial completion or that outstanding works could reasonably be completed within the next 3 months. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.4em;"><strong>How has the Council come to this conclusion?</strong> </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">A property will be considered to have reached a stage of substantial completion when it meets the following criteria: </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The basic structure is complete, for example all external walls and roof in place. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Internal walls are built (although not necessarily plastered). </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Floors laid (although the screed or top coat of concrete need not have been laid). </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">A notice may also be served if the above criteria is not fully met but the Council consider that any outstanding works could reasonably be completed within the next 3 months. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">In order to be considered and ready for banding, the following work does </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; line-height: 1.7em;"><strong>not</strong> </span><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">need to have been carried out: </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Internal decoration of the property. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Final fitting of sanitary ware and kitchen units </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Final fitting of electrical plug points and switches </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Final connection of water, gas and electricity (although services should be laid on to the site). </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.4em;">How can the Council issue a completion notice for council tax purposes when neither Building Control nor the National House Building Council have issued their completion notice? </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The completion notices issued for council tax purposes are not the same as completion notices issued under Building Control Regulations, as they both serve different purposes. Even if a completion notice has not been issued under Building Control Regulations, it does not prevent one from being issued for Council Tax or, if one has been, it does not mean a different date cannot be used. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">Similarly, the completion date does not refer to the date the property is sold - it refers to the date the property is structurally complete, which is usually before the date of sale. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.4em;">Does this mean I now have to start paying council tax? </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">New properties, whether newly constructed or created by conversion, which are unoccupied and substantially unfurnished are exempt from Council Tax for any period of up to six months. Once the six months has expired, provided the property remains unfurnished and unoccupied, a 100% empty charge then falls due. </span><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.7em;">Therefore, from the date of completion, a builder has six months in which to let or sell the new property, before they become liable for a charge.</strong><br /><strong style="line-height: 1.7em;">Valuation Office</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">To help the Valuation Office band properties from the correct day, we supply it with copies of all completion notices served, plus information as to any completion notices withdrawn or revised agreements reached. </span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.7em;">The contact details for the Valuation Office are:- </span><br />
