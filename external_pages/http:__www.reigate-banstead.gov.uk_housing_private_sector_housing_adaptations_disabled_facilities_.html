            <h1>Disabled facilities</h1>
                    <div class="editor">
<p>We offer mandatory disabled facilities grants for the following type of 
works, subject to the advice of the Surrey County Council's Occupational 
Therapists and advice from relevant experts.</p> 
  <p>We also offer <a href="/info/20072/private_sector_housing/528/small_scale_improvements" tcmuri="tcm:9-562">Small Works Grants and Loans</a>.</p> 
  <h2>a) Making it easier for the disabled person to access:</h2> 
  <ol> 
    <li>the home or the building in which the flat or maisonette is situated
</li> 
    <li>the room used/usable as a main family room
</li> 
    <li>the room used/usable for sleeping
</li> 
    <li>a room in which there is a lavatory, a bath or shower (or both) and a wash 
hand basin 
</li> 
    <li>a facility for the preparation and cooking of food.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>b) Provision of a bedroom or bathroom</h2> 
  <p>N.B. Providing a room suitable for sleeping or making it easier to use the 
lavatory, bath, shower or wash hand basin will only be considered where the 
Council is satisfied that adaptation of an existing room, or access to that room 
is not suitable in that particular case.</p> 
  <p>Should provision of an accessible bedroom be required and the disabled person 
would normally share a bedroom with someone else, that grant will enable a room 
big enough to maintain normal sleeping arrangements of the household.</p> 
  <p>Some living rooms may be large enough to create a room, which could be used 
as a bedroom instead of extending the property.</p> 
  <p>Consideration will always be given to the use of stair lifts or through floor 
lifts to obtain suitable access internally as an initial option.</p> 
  <h2>c) Making a home or building safe for the disabled occupant or other people 
living with them</h2> 
  <p>Such works of adaptation that may be considered are:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>providing lighting where safety is an issue or the disabled occupant is 
poorly sighted and needs the lighting to live independently
</li> 
    <li>adaptations to minimise danger where the disabled person has behavioural 
problems which cause them to act occasionally or regularly in a boisterous or 
violent manner damaging the house, him/herself or other people
</li> 
    <li>an enhanced alarm system for people with hearing difficulties to provide 
improved safety for the disabled occupant in connection with the use of cooking 
facilities or means of escape in a fire
</li> 
    <li>other areas covered might include toughened or shatterproof glass, 
installing guards to fires or radiators, reinforcement of floors, walls or 
ceilings or the provision of cladding to prevent self injury.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <h2>d) Making it easier for the disabled person to prepare and cook food</h2> 
  <p>This covers a wide range of works to enable the disabled person to cater for 
themselves or their family independently.</p> 
  <p>It includes specially modified or designed units, gas, electricity and 
plumbing installations and the rearrangements or enlargement of a kitchen, for 
example, to manoeuvre a wheelchair.</p> 
  <p>In the case where a disabled person does not prepare or cook food it would 
not be appropriate to adapt the kitchen but some adaptations may be permitted to 
enable the disabled person to make drinks or light meals.</p> 
  <h2>e) Improving the heating system</h2> 
  <p>Improving the heating system in the home to meet the needs of the disabled 
occupant. Alternatively, if there is no existing heating system in the home, or 
the system is unsuitable for use by the disabled occupant, to provide a heating 
system suitable for their needs.</p> 
  <p>People with limited mobility that remain in one room for long periods of time 
usually need greater warmth than mobile able-bodied people. Therefore assistance 
will be available for those parts of the accommodation used by the disabled 
person to provide suitable background temperatures.</p> 
  <p>Assistance will also be given where for example unsuitable heating is 
installed e.g. solid fuel heaters where fuel has to be carried in from 
outside.</p> 
  <p>Grant will not be available to heat rooms not normally used by the disabled 
person, so it is unlikely that full central heating systems will be grant 
aided.</p> 
  <p>Likewise it is unlikely that one form of central heating when replaced with 
another form of central heating will be grant aided except in exceptional 
circumstances.</p> 
  <h2>f) Making it easier for the disabled person to get into/out of the home and 
get around the home so they can care for a person who also lives there and is in 
need of such care</h2> 
  <p>This provides for grant aid to allow a disabled person to care for someone 
who normally resides with them whether or not they are related to the disabled 
person.</p> 
  <p>This may include spouse, partner or family member, another disabled person or 
a child.</p> 
  <p>Such works could include the provision of access to an upper floor for care 
of the dependant when the disabled person would not normally have to have access 
to the upper floor for any other reasons.</p> 
  <p>Works can include ramps to provide access to the dwelling.</p> 
  <p>Access to all other areas of the dwelling as a matter of course would not 
normally be considered for grant aid.</p> 
  <p>Disabled Facilities Grants can also assist with works to the common parts of 
the building containing flats, where the disabled person is the occupant of one 
of the flats.</p> 
  <p>Normally these works are limited to those to facilitate access to the 
dwelling through the common parts or facilitating the use of a source of power, 
lighting or heating in the common parts, by the disabled person.</p> 
  <h2>Who is eligible for these grants?</h2> 
  <p>For the purposes of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 
1996 and The Regulatory Reform Order (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) 
Order 2002, a person is disabled if:</p> 
  <p>a) their sight, hearing or speech is substantially impaired; <br />b) they have 
a mental disorder or impairment of any kind; or <br />c) they are physically 
substantially disabled by illness, injury, impairment present from birth, or 
otherwise.</p> 
  <p>A person aged eighteen or over will be regarded as disabled if:</p> 
  <p>a) they are registered in pursuance of any arrangements made under section 
29(1) of the National Assistance Act 1948 ('disabled persons' welfare); or 
<br />b) they are a person for whom welfare arrangements have been made under the 
provision or, in the opinion of the social services authority, might be made 
under it.</p> 
  <p>A person under 18 will be regarded as being disabled if:</p> 
  <p>a) they are registered in a register of disabled children maintained under 
paragraph 2 of schedule 2 to the Children Act 1989; or <br />b) they are, in the 
opinion of the social services authority, a disabled child as defined for the 
purposes of Part III of the Children Act 1989 (local authority support for 
children and their families).</p> 
  <h2>Ineligibility for grants</h2> 
  <p>No grant will be given for any works started before an applicant has received 
a grant approval from the Council</p> 
  <p>There may be certain instances where a grant cannot be given by the Council 
as certain criteria cannot be met by the applicant e.g. cannot demonstrate the 
requisite interest in the dwelling, or provide a certificate of future 
occupation, or a disabled person's home cannot be classed as a &quot;dwelling&quot;. </p> 
  <p>It may be that the works requested are not considered reasonable or 
practical. In these instances the Welfare Authority, the County Council, still 
has a duty to assist with the adaptations or alternative schemes where they have 
indicated the works necessary and appropriate.</p>
