      <h2>Fostering</h2>
      
      <h3>Local foster families for local children</h3>
<p>Fostering is a way of providing a family life for children who cannot live with their own families. Their families might be going through a difficult time or be ill.</p>
<p>There is a huge need for more foster carers so that children can be matched with families who best reflect the child's background and culture and so that, wherever possible, children can be placed near to their own families, schools and communities. </p>
<p>We need all kinds of carers to offer a range of placements from long and short term to specialist pieces of work with children facing challenges in their lives. We will offer you an excellent financial package and all the local training and support you need at any time of day.</p>
<p>Could you make a difference to a child's life today?</p>
<p>If you are up for the challenge, contact us:</p>

          <p>Fostering isn't easy but is extremely satisfying. </p>
<p>Helping vulnerable young people feel secure and good about themselves makes the experience worthwhile and is highly rewarding. </p>
<p>Foster carers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote the healthy growth and development of children</li>
<li>Provide a safe and caring environment, keeping children from harm</li>
<li>Encourage children to take part in school, further education, training or employment</li>
<li>Promote positive behaviour and act as an advocate</li>
</ul>
<p>Be part of the team.</p>
<ul>
<li>You won't be alone and would be working with a team of people, including social workers and other professionals</li>
<li>Taking part in meetings and help make decisions about the child's care</li>
<li>There are many local training courses to help you develop your skills and learning</li>
<li>You would be working with parents to encourage and supervise contact. Most children keep regular contact with their families</li>
<li>For many children the plan is for them to return home and their parents still have some responsibilities for them</li>
<li>Fostering can be for a few days, weeks, months or long term for years until a child becomes an adult</li>

        <h3 class="tc-header h6"><a href="#30110" class="toggleContent">Why do some children need fostering?</a></h3>
        <div id="30110" class="panelContent">
          <p>Fostering is a way of providing a family life for children who cannot live with their own parents. Their parents might be going through a difficult time or be ill.</p>
<p>Often children will return home once the problems that caused them to come into foster care have been resolved. </p>
<p>Fostering helps children prepare for the next move. That could be returning home, long term fostering, becoming an independent adult or finding a new family through adoption.</p>
<p>A child can need foster care for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A member of the family has a drug or alcohol related problem which seriously affects the safety or care of the child</li>
<li>There are major problems and tensions in the family and children feel that they need to be away from home for a while</li>
<li>The child has been physically or sexually abused or seriously neglected by someone in the home</li>
<li>Families of disabled children or children with behavioural difficulties may benefit from short breaks, where the child enjoys time in a new environment and the parents have some time to themselves</li>
<li>A young person has been remanded into foster care by the court</li>
<li>A child is an unaccompanied refugee or asylum seeker</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a huge need for more foster carers so that children can be matched with families who best reflect the child's background and culture and so that, wherever possible, children can be placed near to their own families, schools and communities.  </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="toggle-container">
        <h3 class="tc-header h6"><a href="#6613" class="toggleContent">What are the types of foster care?</a></h3>
        <div id="6613" class="panelContent">
          <h3>Short term or long term care</h3>
<p>A child might come into care because of an illness or accident or a serious incident at home. Whatever the reasons, social services will be working with the family to resolve the issues so that the child can return home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Some children are unable to return to their families. They will require a stable, long term fostering placement until they reach the age of 18 or beyond.</p>
<h3>Family and friends</h3>
<p>Family and friends carers play a key role in allowing children to remain living with adults that they know and trust if, for whatever reason, they cannot live with their birth parents. In such cases Herefordshire Council is committed to ensuring that, where possible, a child or young person can remain living within their own family network. </p>
<p>The support that family and friends carers receive is critical to the success of any placement.</p>
<h3>Brothers and sisters</h3>
<p>Wherever possible siblings should be placed together. For many foster children, the relationship with their brothers and sisters is what they value most when separated from their family and staying together is very important.</p>
<h3>Disabled children</h3>
<p>We need carers with experience of caring for children with physical or learning difficulties and other additional needs.</p>
<h3>Parent and child</h3>
<p>We need carers who can help to give extra support in their home to new parents and their babies, particularly teenage mums.</p>
<h3>Emergency placement</h3>
<p>We need foster carers who have an interest in and an understanding of children coming from other cultures and can provide short periods of care until plans are made for their future.</p>
<p>We need places for children that need somewhere safe to stay for a few nights.</p>
<h3>Older children</h3>
<p>We need carers who can foster teenagers. Carers who can inspire and provide them with an environment to help them build independent living skills and help them build a positive future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you be a role model to a young person?</li>
<li>Can you inspire and encourage them to grow into young adults?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Herefordshire Intensive Placement Support Service (HIPSS)</h3>
<p>Herefordshire Intensive Placement Support Service (HIPSS) is a therapeutic fostering service to children and young people looked after by Herefordshire Council with the most complex needs that would normally need to be cared for in residential care, away from their local communities and networks.</p>
<p>Therapeutic foster care gives children and young people who have experienced significant trauma in their lives an opportunity to overcome adversity and have the chance to form stable and secure relationships with their carers and live appropriately ordinary lives.</p>
<p>HIPSS is a dedicated friendly, creative team of professionals from psychology, education, social care, fostering and youth work. We work with children and young people aged 7-18 years with complex needs.</p>

<h3>Private fostering</h3>
<p>Private fostering is when a child or young person under 16 (or 18 if disabled) goes to live for 28 days or more with someone who is not a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parent (including step parent)</li>
<li>Legal guardian or person with parental responsibility</li>
<li>Close relative (like grandparent, brother or sister, aunt or uncle)</li>
</ul>

<h3>​Supported lodgings </h3>
<p>Young people often need support with becoming independent. Especially those people who have lived in care or have been homeless. Supported lodgings provide a safe place for them to become confident and learn about living as an adult.</p>
<p><a href="/health-and-social-care/children-and-family-care/fostering/supported-lodgings" class="submit-button go-arrow">Learn more about supported lodgings</a></p>
<h3>Short breaks scheme</h3>
<p>The short breaks scheme provides overnight, family-based, short break provision for children with disabilities, allowing them to have a new experience and for their families to have some rest.</p>
<p>​Anyone can be a short breaks carer. There are no specialist skills or qualifications required. However, we would be particularly interested in hearing from people with professional or personal experience of children with disabilities. We will train you and provide all the support you need. All we ask is that you are understanding, patient and committed to caring for a child who has disabilities.</p>
<p>Being a short break carer is a highly rewarding challenge. If you think you have what it takes, get in touch with us to find out more.</p>
