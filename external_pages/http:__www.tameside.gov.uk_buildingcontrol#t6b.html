</ul>
<h2 class="palegreen black"><a name="t2"></a>How to Make an Application</h2>
<p>There are two options through the Council when you choose to carry out work to which the Building Regulations apply;</p>
<h3><a name="t2a"></a><a name="fullplan"></a>Full Plans Option</h3>
<p>(<a href="/buildingcontrol/fullplan11.pdf">Download the Full Plans Application Form</a> <small>80.76 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" />)</p>
<p>This is the most widely known and used option, where scaled plans clearly indicating the proposed constructional details and where necessary supporting structural calculations, have to be submitted.</p>
<p>A Building Control Surveyor will check the plans for compliance with the Building Regulations. Any queries or problems will be conveyed to you or your agent (if applicable) at a time when they can easily be corrected and when these are resolved an approval notice is issued.</p>
<p>Full plans applications are subject to a maximum time period of 5 weeks, extendable on request to 2 months, by which a decision should be made.</p>
<p><strong>A Full plans application approval is valid for 3 years from date of deposit.</strong></p>
<p>Advantages of this system are that you receive a formal approval notice, which can be presented to financial institutions, solicitors, surveyors, etc when seeking loans or moving house. Also you have the assurance that provided the work is carried out in accordance with the approved plans the Building Regulations will be satisfied and this can save expensive mistakes.</p>
<p>After plan approval when the works start, Building Control Surveyors will carryout various <a href="#t5d">Site Inspections</a> to determine that the building works being undertaken complies with the Building Regulations.</p>
<p>Charges for the 'Full Plans' option are normally required in two stages.</p>
<p>A charge is payable when an application is submitted and a further charge is payable after the first inspection of the works on site (some minor works are paid fully on submission and are not subject to this second charge. See <a href="/buildingcontrol/charges">Building Control Charges</a>).</p>
<h4><span class="green"><strong>To Submit the Application:</strong></span></h4>
<p>Complete the <a href="/buildingcontrol/fullplans/guidance">full plans application form</a> and include at least two copies* of :</p>
<ul>
    <li title="*">All detailed plans / specifications and calculations.</li>
    <li title="*">A 1:1250 scale location plan (block plan), showing the size and position of the proposal and its relationship to adjoining boundaries.</li>
    <li title="*">The appropriate charge payment (please have a look at the <a href="/buildingcontrol/charges">Building Control Charges</a> page).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*An additional two copies of the plans are required for work to properties where persons are employed and / or are subject to a Fire Certificate under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 e.g. shops, factories, offices, public buildings etc.</em></p>
<p><strong>Payment by Cheque</strong></p>
<p>Please make your cheques payable to <strong>'Tameside MBC'</strong> and if you are making a planning application at the same time, please ensure you include separate cheques for each application.</p>
<h3><a name="t2b"></a>Building Notice Option</h3>
<p>Under this option no detailed plans are required (see restrictions on it's use below) and once the notice has been submitted you have to wait 48 hours before starting the work. The total fee for the work has to be paid when the <strong>Building Notice</strong> is submitted.</p>
<p>This procedure is useful for carrying out smaller projects, such as bathroom installations, minor structural alterations and small domestic extensions, but this assumes that the person carrying out the work is fully conversant with the requirements of the Building Regulations which relate to the project and has the necessary construction skills to ensure the building is erected in accordance with these regulations. Should this not be the case then you are advised to have detailed construction plans prepared, showing full compliance with the regulations and make a Full Plans application.</p>
<p><strong>As you are proceeding without approved plans, it is critical that your building work is undertaken with adequate supervision. Building Control Surveyors will attempt to establish compliance with the Building Regulations, but this service does not constitute total works supervision, as our visits are limited in scope and number. You are advised to seek the additional services of your own Architect, Surveyor of Clerk of works for a full works supervision service.</strong></p>
<p>No formal approval is given for works covered by this Building Notice procedure, nor do you have the advantage of a Full plans application where plans will have been pre-checked before the work commences and gives yourself and your builder some comfort that the works you intend to carryout do indeed comply with the Building Regulations.</p>
<p>The whole process of making sure your work complies with the Building Regulations is carried out on site and should a problem be found by your Building Control Surveyor on his/her inspections, it will usually be <strong>after</strong> you have carried out a significant amount of work, which you may then have to undertake remedial works to bring into regulation compliance.</p>
<p>Also be aware under this option, we can ask for further information, which could comprise of architectural drawings or structural calculations are found to be necessary to enable building control to discharge it's functions. This information provision should not be confused with the <a href="#fullplan">full plans application</a> process as no plans will be approved under the Building Notice process.</p>
<p>Please remember you are required to give 48 hours notice of your intention to commence work at least 24 hours notice before various stages of the proposals construction are reached (see site works notifications below) to give us opportunity to inspect the works as we feel is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that under the Building Notice procedure the council are under no obligation to issue completion certificates in relation to Building Regulations and you will only receive a letter of the works completion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If in doubt make a full plans application.</strong></p>
<p>A Building Notice application is valid for 3 years from date of acknowledgement.</p>
<p><strong>It cannot be used</strong> for premises where people are employed or where a Fire Certificate under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 is applicable e.g. shops, factories, offices, public buildings etc.</p>
<p><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Where the proposals consisting of either underpinning, extensions or new build affects or is likely to affect access to or is built over a drain, sewer or disposal main indicated on the map of sewers kept by the sewerage undertakers.</p>
<p><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Works involves the erection of any building fronting onto a private street.</p>
<p>In these two cases you must submit a <a href="#fullplan">full application under the Full Plans</a> procedures above.</p>
<h4><span class="green">To Submit the Application:</span></h4>
<p>Download the <a href="/buildingnotice">Building Notice application form</a>, complete and return with the appropriate charge payment. This fee is equivalent to the combined "Plan Fee" and "Inspection Fee" which would be payable when making a "Full Plans" application. (<a href="/buildingcontrol/charges">please have a look at the Building Control Charges page</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Note: For New Build and Extensions</strong> - a 1:1250 scale location plan (block plan), showing the proposals size and position and its relationship to adjoining boundaries, together with a drainage plan indicating the proposals drainage discharges to the existing drainage systems, the position and depth of existing drainage runs <strong>must be provided</strong>.</p>
<h3><a name="t2c"></a>Charges</h3>
<p>Building Regulation work is subject to charges (<a href="/buildingcontrol/charges">please have a look at the Building Control Charges page</a>).</p>
<p>Charges for the 'Full Plans' option are normally required in two stages.</p>
<p>A charge is payable when an application is submitted and a further charge is payable after the first inspection of the works on site (some minor works are paid fully on submission and are not subject to this second charge).</p>
<p>In the case of a 'Building Notice' option a single charge is payable upon submission of the notice. <strong>Note - because of the lack of detailed construction drawings for this type of application, the charges are slightly more than the combined "plan charge" and "inspection charge" that would be payable when making a "Full Plans" application to account for additional site inspection time that is involved.</strong></p>

<h2 class="palegreen black"><a id="t3" name="t3"></a>Regularisation Certificates</h2>
<p>It is quite common for alterations or extensions undertaken without building regulation approval to cause difficulties when you are selling a house.</p>
<p>This happens when the vendor <strong>cannot </strong>supply the purchaser with the appropriate approval notice and/or completion certificate. This calls into question the quality of building construction and the structural integrity of the work. However, you can now apply to <strong>Building Control </strong>for a Regularisation Certificate for work undertaken after 11th November 1985 which will assist this but you need to be aware that a fee is payable to the Council and breaches to the building regulations may need to be rectified. <a href="/buildingcontrol/bcregap10.pdf">You can download the application form</a> <small>35.22 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" /> and the <a href="/buildingcontrol/regapp17.pdf">Guidance Note on Regularisation Applications</a>.<small>40.81 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" /></p>
<h2 class="palegreen black"><a id="t4" name="t4"></a>Replacement Windows</h2>
<p>Are you thinking of replacing your windows? <a href="/buildingcontrol/replacingwindows">Read the new legislation</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h2 class="palegreen black"><a id="t4a" name="t4a"></a>Electrical Works</h2>
<p>Are you thinking of having any electrical works carried out to your house / flat, in your garden or outbuildings or associated with any other building or alteration work? Read the new legislation and requirements in <a href="/buildingcontrol/guidancenotes/note20.pdf">Part P Electrical Works Guide Note 20</a> <small>281.31 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" /></p>
<h3><span class="palegreen black"><a id="t4c" name="t4c"></a></span>Self Certification Schemes</h3>
<p>Similar to the schemes provided for replacement windows and electrical works, you can avoid having to submit a Building Regulation application for certain elements of work if you employ a 'Competent Person Scheme Member' to undertake such works.</p>
<p>Certain members of Government approved trade bodies are allowed to carryout works - they still have to notify the Local Authority, but this is done by their Trade association. The schemes coverage is explained in <a href="/buildingcontrol/guidancenotes/note26.pdf">Guidance Note 26 - Competent Person schemes and exemption of minor works</a> <small>71.2 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" />.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="t5b" name="t5b"></a>Planning Permission - Important Note</strong></h3>
<p>Before works commence, you or your builder (where applicable) are advised to check the conditions that will have been set out on your planning approval (where one was necessary) - it is important to avoid future problems that all the conditions are complied with.</p>
<p>You will also normally have to agree samples of the external materials to be used with the planning officer before the work commences.</p>
<p>Should the site works deviate from the approved planning permission in any way due to site variations and problems, you must discuss these as soon as is possible with the local planning officer to avoid problems occurring.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts about planning related issues <a href="/planning/generalinfo">please contact the appropriate Planning Service</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h3><a id="t5c" name="t5c"></a>Building Control</h3>
<p><strong>Irrespective of the type of Building Regulation application made, building work must be inspected during its progress and sufficient notice must be given to enable the Building Control Surveyor to arrange site visits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before works commence you or your builder are advised to check for any conditions that may have been set out on your Building Regulation approval - it is important to avoid future problems that all the conditions (where applicable) are complied with.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><a id="t5d" name="t5d"></a>Site Inspections</strong></h3>
<p>Building Control can carry out site inspections to determine that building works being undertaken comply with the Building Regulations.</p>
<p>The number and nature of the site inspections vary according to the type of works being undertaken, the builders experience and past building control record.</p>
<p>You must give us a minimum of 48 hours before you commence the building work, this can be done by using the commencement notice provided with your approval or attached to the building notice form. You can download a copy of the <a href="/buildingcontrol/commencement.pdf">Commencement Notice Form</a> <small>19.38 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" /> or <strong>use the</strong> <a href="http://public.tameside.gov.uk/forms/f444buildinginsp384.asp">on-line Commencement Notice Form</a> or <a href="#t7">you can obtain a copy from Building Control.</a></p>
<p>After we carry out our first inspection, you will be invoiced directly for a one-off inspection charge as laid out in the appropriate charge scales <a href="/buildingcontrol/charges">Building Control Charges</a> (note - some works are not subject to this charge as it will have been paid on the applications submission).</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you have not obtained approval where the 'full plan' application option is followed, any works commenced will continue at <em>your own risk </em>until approval is granted and any works found to be wrong on the plan examination and carried out on site will have to be corrected by yourself or your contractor.</p>
<p>If you are undertaking works under a Building Notice application no formally approved plans exist and you must take further steps to ensure you or your contactor fully comply with the Building Regulations. If you have any doubt about your contractor's competency to work without full plans or the ability to manage the project without detailed plans and specifications, then you should consider engaging an architect or chartered building surveyor to supervise the works, in addition to the limited building regulation inspections the council undertakes.</p>
<p>You or your builder are then required to give us 24 hours notification of reaching certain stages in the projects construction, these are listed below for a typical domestic extension:</p>
<p>Please note that it is a statutory requirement that any work for which there is a statutory notification be left accessible to inspect for 24 hours from the midnight after the notice was given.</p>
<p>For domestic extensions the following statutory notifications have to be made to Building Control -</p>

<p>For commercial projects the we elect to carryout will vary depending upon the size and scale of the project being undertaken and these can be discussed at the commencement stage.</p>
<p><strong>Please be advised that any inspections we carry out are limited in scope and purpose to check Building Regulations compliance which related predominantly to health and safety matters.

<p>You can notify us of reaching the above stages by either using the downloadable <a href="/buildingcontrol/inspecreq.pdf">Inspection Request Form</a> <small>20.36 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" /> or the <a href="http://public.tameside.gov.uk/forms/f444buildinginsp384.asp">on-line Inspection Notice Form</a><strong>, </strong>alternatively you can <a href="http://online.tameside.gov.uk:8080/crm_public/secure_message_intro.do?hide=true&amp;dept=BuildingControl&amp;subject=Building%20Control%20Enquiry">Send a message to Building Control</a> or telephone the Building Control office before 10.00am weekdays to arrange inspections. <b>24 hours prior notification is required as same day inspections cannot be guaranteed and please be advised due to the volume of calls received the phone lines can be very busy.</b></p>
<p><b>Unfortunately due to the nature of the inspection service and the need to be available to deal with dangerous building callouts timed inspections cannot be offered. Preferences for am/pm visits can be noted by the admin team but no guarantee can be offered that these will be possible to meet as the nature of the visit rota is area based.</b></p>
<p>Finally, you are requested upon completion to contact Building Control to arrange for a completion inspection (Where internal access will be necessary), please contact the Building Control&nbsp;using the details at the bottom of this page. You can use the completion notice sent to you or <a href="/buildingcontrol/compnotice.pdf">use the downloadable Completion Notice</a> <small>15.38 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" /> or use the <a href="http://public.tameside.gov.uk/forms/f444buildinginsp384.asp">on-line Completion Form</a>.</p>
<p>Please allow up to 7 days for this inspection to be made.</p>
<h3><a name="parkperiods"></a>Peak Periods/Dangerous Buildings Incidents</h3>
<p>At times of high workload each visit will be prioritised by risk assessment and you may be instructed to continue without an inspection. Regardless of whether it has been decided to inspect your work you are still required to notify Building Control at the above statutory notification stages.</p>
<p>During the working day the surveyors are responsible for attending to dangerous building incidents that come into the authority and the disruption to the inspection routine depending upon the severity of the incident cannot be planned.</p>
<h3><a id="t5e" name="t5e"></a>Completion Certificates</h3>
<p><span style="color: black">Where you have used the <b>&lsquo;Full Plans&rsquo; application route</b>, provided all plan approval conditions and all issues found on inspections are satisfactorily resolved, all statutory notifications have been made to building control and the required building services commissioning and test certification have been provided. Once the Building Control Surveyor has made a completion inspection and is satisfied that the work as inspected appears to comply with the Building Regulations, a "Completion Certificate" can be issued. This certificate is often now required for the sale of your property.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black">Again you are reminded that this certificate is considered as evidence (but not conclusive evidence) that, insofar as the authority has been able to ascertain, the works as described in the certificate are in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations. They are not a guarantee of a projects compliance with all building standards, nor of a projects workmanship quality.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: black">For &lsquo;Building Notice&rsquo; applications no completion certificates will be issued.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: black">Late Completion requests - </span><strong><span style="color: black">There is a legal requirement for the owner to give the local authority written notification a minimum of 5 days prior to occupation or completion of the works related to the Building Regulations application.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: black">Where this has failed to be provided an the works are more than 3 years old from our last recorded visit our files are normally written off and no completion requests can be accepted due to the failure to comply with this legal notification request an the expiration of our statutory 2 year enforcement time period.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: black">Provision of late completion inspection for jobs under 3 years from our last recorded inspection</span></strong><span style="color: black"> - due to the requirement to open up the archived files and verify its inspection history a request has to be put in writing to building control. If the case history is sufficient to allow for a completion inspection to be made and all necessary supporting test information is provided an additional charge as set out in our scale of charges will be required to be paid in advance of the completion inspection inspection. <strong>This process can take upto 28 days</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Completion certification can only be issued where the project is determined to comply with the Building Regulations requirements and should additional works to be found to be required on our completion visit all works will have to be corrected and re-inspected to verify compliance (additional charges may be incurred in accordance with our scale of charges hourly rates).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Completion Certificates were and cannot be issued on projects completed prior to 1st January 2000.</p>
<p>If you have failed to comply with the completion/occupation legal notifications and no completion certificates exists and the property is to be sold you will have to discuss this matter with your legal representative.</p>
<h2 class="palegreen black"><a id="t6" name="t6"></a>Other Building Control Functions</h2>
<p></p>
<h2><a id="t6a" name="t6a"></a>Dangerous Buildings</h2>
<p>Building Control has a statutory duty to deal with Dangerous Buildings and Structures throughout the borough.</p>
<p>Our objective is to safeguard public safety by dealing with any situation that may arise. We have the Statutory Authority to take legal action against the buildings or structures owner who does not take steps to remove any potential danger.</p>
<p>Our powers under dangerous building legislation do not however extend to dealing with dilapidated premises, which may be in a poor condition, but do not present a danger to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Important Notice: Dangerous Buildings</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you wish to report a building or structure that poses an immediate danger,&nbsp;please contact us using the details at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>
<h2>Information to be provided:</h2>
<ul>
    <li title="*">Address of Danger.</li>
    <li title="*">Precise description of what you consider to be dangerous and its location.</li>
    <li title="*">Any known ownership details/ access provisions that will assist Building Control in dealing with the complaint.</li>
    <li title="*">Your name and contact details so we can advise you of the action taken (optional).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="demolition"></a><a id="t6b" name="t6b"></a>Demolition</h2>
<p>When intending to demolish a building, official notice must be given to Building Control, usually a minimum of six weeks prior to the intended start date. You can use the <a href="http://public.tameside.gov.uk/forms/f435demolition389.asp">Intended Demolition online form</a> or request the standard notification form. Alternatively download copy of the <a href="/buildingcontrol/sec8010.pdf">Intended Demolition Form</a> <small>38.85 KB</small> <img src="/tmbc_images/include/pdf.gif" alt="PDF File" height="20" width="34" class="absmiddle" />.</p>
<p>In order for us to process this application you must also provide a 1:1250 location plan clearly indicating the buildings to be demolished, all adjacent properties and existing drainage systems to be sealed, together with a copy of the demolition contractor's method statement indicating safe methods of demolition. We will also require evidence that a Refurbishment and Demolition Asbestos survey has been carried out and a copy should be sent to the contact address indicated below.</p>
<p>Within 6 weeks of receiving this completed application, we will issue a Demolition Notice setting out a number of conditions that have to be complied with during the demolition works necessary to maintain public safety and public amenity.</p>
<p>Building Control may also consult Environmental Health / Highways / Planning Departments and the GMC Fire Service prior to the issuing of a demolition notice.</p>
<p>You should also notify all service providers such as gas, electric etc by sending them a copy of the notification form and location plan, in order that they may arrange with yourselves for their services to be safely disconnected.</p>
<h2>Planning Permission</h2>
<p>The demolition works you are proposing may also require prior consent under planning legislation. You are advised to speak to development control early in your programming to determine the position with respect to this matter to avoid any delays.</p>
<h2><a id="t6d" name="t6d"></a>Public Entertainments Licences</h2>
<p>Building Control Surveyors provide technical support to the Council's <a href="/licensing">Licensing Section</a>, which is responsible for the issuing of Public Entertainments Licences.</p>
<h2 class="palegreen black"><a id="t7" name="t7"></a>How to Contact Us</h2>
<p>Owing to the size of the area being covered and a more flexible approach to early morning and late afternoon visits being adopted, there will no longer be any set time that surveyors can be contacted in the office. The only way to speak to them direct will be to leave a message using the contact details at the bottom of this page</p>
<p>Please also note due to the limited size of the building control team it is no longer possible to have surveyors dedicated to a specific area/project and you may see a number of different surveyors during the course of your project. <br />
</p>
<p>This will differ on major projects where named surveyors will be allocated.<br />
</p>
<p>If your enquiry is to seek advice regarding certain aspects of works requiring permission, the building control guidance notes page provides detailed advisory guidance leaflets to assist you.</p>
<p>There is no staffed reception service for Building Control and if you wish to meet a particular surveyor please contact the office to make a timed appointment when you can be seen.</p>
