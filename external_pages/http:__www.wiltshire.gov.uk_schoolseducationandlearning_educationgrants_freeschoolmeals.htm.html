<h2>Who is entitled to free school meals?<a name="free_school_meals-entitled-Anchor"></a></h2>
<h4>Universal infant free school meals</h4>
<p>All infant school children, those in reception, year 1 and year 2 have been entitled to free school meals since September 2014. Just tell your school that you want your child or children to have free school meals.</p>
<p>If your infant child would have been entitled to free school meals under the old system, because you are receiving qualifying benefits (listed below) the government will give your school a Pupil Premium of &#160;&#163;1,300 for primary-aged pupils (2014-2015).</p>
<p>For the school and your child to benefit from this money we need to know that you are receiving a qualifying benefit. Please complete the form which is available from your school or download it - <a href="./infant-pupil-premium-claim-form.pdf" target="_blank" class="document" title="Infant pupil premium claim form"><img src="pdf.gif" alt="PDF" height="10" width="10" />Infant pupil premium claim form <span class="synopsis">Infant pupil premium claim form</span><span class="filesize"> 91kb</span></a>.</p>
<h4>Junior and secondary pupils</h4>
<p>For children in years 3 and above, free school meals are not provided automatically. They can be awarded only if you receive any of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Income Support</li>
<li>Job Seeker's Allowance (income-based)</li>
<li>Employment and Support Allowance (income-related)</li>
<li>support under part six of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>
<li>the Guarantee element of State Pension Credit</li>
<li>Child Tax Credit - providing you are NOT entitled to Working Tax Credit and your family's annual income (as assessed by HMRC) is not more than &#163;16,190 (as at 6 April 2012) </li>
<li>Working Tax Credit 'run-on' - the payment you may receive for a further four weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit.</li></ul>
<p><strong>If you are receiving Working Tax Credit you are not entitled to free school meals, regardless of your income.<br /></strong></p>
<p>The exception is during the four-week 'run on' period when you may have stopped qualifying for but are still receiving payment of Working Tax Credit.</p>
<p>Children who receive Income Support or income-based Job Seeker's Allowance in their own right qualify as well. All pupils who do not qualify for free school meals must be charged the same amount for the same quantity of the same item.</p>
<p>Free school meals are available to eligible children that attend school within Wiltshire, on a full-time basis. This includes nursery children (of compulsory school age) who attend school full-time and sixth form students (but NOT college or further education level students). If you live in Wiltshire, but your child attends schools in another local authority area (for example Swindon), you should apply via that local authority.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Did you know that registering your child for free school meals means that the school gets extra money?<a name="free_school_meals-school-moneyAnchor"></a></h2>
<p>The government is giving money to schools to help children from lower income families do their very best. This funding is called a Pupil Premium.</p>
<p>For every child registered the school gets &#163;935 for secondary-aged pupils or &#163;1,300 for primary-aged pupils (2014-2015). &#160;Examples of how this money can be spent include:</p>
<ul><li>Purchasing specialist support, audit of provision, developing the vision</li>
<li>CPD for key staff</li>
<li>Developing a creative curriculum</li>
<li>Resources to support inclusion, software focused on specific needs</li>
<li>Purchase of technology resources for individuals, existing, new and emerging</li>
<li>Developing strategies for engaging children and parents in and out of school</li>
<li>Developing collaboration, support or mentoring projects</li>
<li>Supporting the work of schools, governors, staff and parents on e-safety</li>
<li>Subsidy of school clubs, specialist teachers to promote engagement.</li></ul>
<p>In addition, in order to make sure that every child and young person in a Wiltshire school is able to reach their full potential, and to attain and achieve the best that they possibly can, we have published a <a href="./2014-17-dce-strat-support-vul-learners.pdf" target="_blank" class="document" title="Strategy for the Support of Vulnerable Learners"><img src="pdf.gif" alt="PDF" height="10" width="10" />Strategy for the Support of Vulnerable Learners <span class="synopsis">Strategy for the Support of Vulnerable Learners.</span><span class="filesize"> 5mb</span></a></p>
<h2>How does it work?<a name="free_school_meals-how-workAnchor"></a></h2>
<p>If you want your child to have a free, healthy meal at lunchtime that&#8217;s great &#8211; they will get the free school meal (saving you more that &#163;350 a year) and the school gets &#163;935 or &#163;1,300 extra (2014-2015).</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want your child to have the free school meals they can continue as normal &#8211; as long as you qualify and are registered, the school still gets &#163;935 or &#163;1,300 extra<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please remember you must qualify and register for the free school meals for the school to receive the extra money even if you do not want your child to have the free school meals.</strong></p>
<p>Please register as soon as possible to make sure your child and others in their class don&#8217;t miss out.</p>
<p>Registering for free school meals is confidential, no one will know you have registered and it will not affect any other benefits you are claiming. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/schoolseducationandlearning/schoolsandcolleges/parentadvice/educationgrants/freeschoolmeals/freeschoolmealsform.htm">Apply online for free school meals</a></li>
