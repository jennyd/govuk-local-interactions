<h2>Application evaluation process</h2>
<p class="leftAligned">Applications must be sent to the licensing authority for the area where the premises are located. &#160;If the premises extend over more than one licensing authority area the application must be made to the licensing authority in which the majority of the premises are situated. </p>
<p class="leftAligned">Applications must be in a specific format and be accompanied by the required fee. &#160;An operating schedule, a plan of the premises and a form of consent from the premises supervisor (for applications where the sale of alcohol will be a licensable activity).</p>
<p class="leftAligned">The operating schedule will include details of:</p>
<div class="lb-list-block-2"><ul><li>The licensable activities </li>
<li>The times when the activities will take place </li>
<li>Any other times when the premises will be open to the public </li>

<p class="leftAligned">Applicants will be required to advertise their application prominently at or on the premises by way of a notice of at least A4 size on light blue paper where it can be read from the exterior and by publication in a local newspaper circulating in the area of the premises. </p>
<p class="leftAligned">Applicants must give notice of their application to the responsible authorities, for example: Environmental Health, Chief of Police.</p>
<p class="leftAligned">The licensing authority must grant the application, which can be subject to conditions if there are no relevant representations. A hearing must be held if any relevant representations are made in respect of the application, unless they are withdrawn. If a hearing is held the licence can be granted or granted subject to conditions, licensable activities listed in the application can be excluded or the application can be refused.</p>
<p class="leftAligned">The licensing authority will serve a notice of its decision on the applicant, any person who has made relevant representations (in other words, representations that were not deemed frivolous or vexatious) and the chief of police.</p>
<p class="leftAligned">Applications can also be made to vary or transfer a licence. A hearing may have to be heard if representations are made or conditions relating to a transfer are not met.</p>
<p class="leftAligned">Other applications that can be made are applications for an interim authority notice following the death, incapacity or insolvency of a licence holder or review applications.</p>

This target date is known as the &#8216;last date for representation&#8217;. The application will be deemed to have been granted the day after the last date for representation. You will be sent your licence within 15 working days of the grant. &#160;</p>
<p class="leftAligned">If relevant representations are made within the 28 day advertising period tacit consent <strong>does not apply</strong> and a public hearing must be held to determine your application. The public hearing will be held within 20 working days after the last date for representation. The hearing date may be extended if the Licensing Authority considers it is in the public interest to do so.</p>
