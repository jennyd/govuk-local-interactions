			        <h1>How do I join the Housing Register?</h1>
			        <p class="lead">The housing register is for people who are 16 and over, who are interested in being considered for a council or housing association home for rent or shared ownership. </p>
			        <p>You will need to complete an <img src="http://www.guildford.gov.uk/images/media/pdficon.gif" style="border: none; vertical-align: middle;" alt="pdf icon" title="" />&nbsp;<a class="inlinemedia id9636 typepdf" href="http://www.guildford.gov.uk/media/9636/Housing-Needs-Register-application-form/pdf/Hhhs119c_-_Application_for_Housing_(colour)_September_2014.pdf" title="Application form to join the housing needs register">application form [324kb]</a>.</p><p>The application form enables you to apply for a council or housing association rented home, a shared ownership home,&nbsp;or both.</p><p>You will need to provide the following documents when you return your application:</p><ul><li>proof of identity for all household members who need to be rehoused with you in the future (e.g. passports, birth certificates - copies are acceptable, but originals will need to be seen prior to rehousing),</li><li>proof of your current address (e.g. recent gas or electricity bill),</li><li>proof you no longer have a financial/legal interest in any previously owned properties and details of any equity received (e.g. completion statement),</li><li>evidence of your right to reside in the UK if you are&nbsp;not a British Citizen (e.g. passport and other relevant documents from the Home Office),</li><li>proof of employment if you work in the Guildford area but do not live in the borough.</li></ul><p>These documents&nbsp;must be up to date and valid.&nbsp;A full list of acceptable documents&nbsp;can be found on the application form.</p><p>If you do not provide us with the documents required your application will not be awarded any priority. Once the documents are received your application will be assessed and placed in the appropriate band from the date the documents were received.</p><p>Details on our banding scheme can be found&nbsp;below under&nbsp;Prioritising applications.</p><h2>Who cannot join the Housing Register?</h2><p>There are also some people who will not, by law, be eligible to join the housing register. These are:</p><ul><li>certain people who are subject to Immigration Control under the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act,</li><li>certain people from abroad who are not subject to immigration control but who are not habitually resident in the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland,</li><li>people (including members of their household) who have been guilty of unacceptable behaviour that makes them unsuitable to be a tenant.</li></ul><h2>Prioritising applications</h2><p>The Council maintains a list of people in need of affordable housing known as the Joint Housing Register. The demand for both rented and shared ownership housing exceeds supply and applications for both are prioritised using banding schemes.</p><p>If you are applying for rented accommodation then your application will be placed in one of five priority bands, A to E, according to your level of housing need. Band A is the highest priority band.</p><p>If you are applying for low cost home ownership then your application will be placed in one of three priority bands, one to three, based on an assessment of your housing need and circumstances. Assessment&nbsp;is based on different criteria to that for rented accommodation. Band&nbsp;one is the highest priority band.</p><p>If you apply for both rented and&nbsp;low cost home ownership&nbsp;accommodation&nbsp;your application will be assessed and you will be placed in a suitable band for each.</p><p>In&nbsp;each band applications are given priority&nbsp;according to the date they&nbsp;entered the band.</p><h2>Housing for rent</h2><p>All housing and transfer applications for rented accommodation will be assessed and placed in one of 5 bands, A to E. The information below sets out the banding scheme and gives examples of those applicants who would be eligible to be placed in each band.

Residents of other local supported housing projects with a local connection of less than 3 years where there is no agreement to move on; applicants of no fixed abode who are not engaging with services.</p><h3>Band E</h3><p>Criteria</p><p>All other cases (to include applicants who have a reasonable preference as defined by the Housing Act 1996 Part VI (as amended by the 2002 Homelessness Act) who do not live or work in the borough of Guildford and anyone who does not qualify for bands A to D.)</p><p>Examples</p><p>Applicants will be placed in this band until all necessary&nbsp;information has been provided and&nbsp;their circumstances have been verified.</p><p>Applicants who have a reasonable preference as defined by the Housing Act 1996 Part VI (as amended by the 2002 Homelessness Act) who do not live or work in the Borough of Guildford including tenants from outside the Borough with a reasonable preference. Applicants assessed as intentionally homeless will remain in this band for a period of 12 months. Social housing tenants in breach of tenancy for 12 months after the breach has been cleared. Demoted applicants due to behaviour or deliberately worsening their circumstances to gain more priority on the housing register. Anyone who does not qualify for Bands A to D</p><h2>Priority within bands</h2><p>Within each band applications will be placed in date order, with the application with the oldest date having the highest priority. The date that is normally used is the date your application was registered with us.</p><h2>Moving between bands</h2><p>If your circumstances change and you move up a band the date used will normally be the date you moved into that band. If you move down a band the date used will normally be the date that you were previously in that band or a higher band.</p><h2>Time limited bands</h2><p>If your application is placed in band A or band B there is a limit on the length of time you can remain in these bands. For band A this is 3 months and for band B it is 6 months. At the end of the time allowed your application will be reviewed and the time extended or priority reduced. There are a few exceptions to this rule where it is unlikely that suitable housing will become available within the timescale.</p><h2>Additional preference</h2><p>In exceptional cases where you can demonstrate that you have a wide range of needs that when considered together are so severe as to warrant higher priority, your application may be given additional preference and moved to a higher band.</p><h2><strong>Local connection </strong></h2><p>To be eligible for bands A and B you must have substantive and long-standing local connection through&nbsp;five years continuous settled residence in the borough. If you do not meet this criteria when you initially make your application you may meet this criteria during the life of your application.</p><p>To be eligible for bands C and D you must meet one of following criteria:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Have lived by choice in borough 3 out of last 5 years</li><li>Have lived by choice in borough continuously for at least 5 years in the past</li><li>Have been permanently employed in borough for at least 12 months and need to be able to live more locally to maintain employment</li><li>Have a close relative who lives in the borough and has done so for past 5 years</li><li>Special circumstances</li></ul><h2>Forces Personnel</h2><p>From 24 August 2012 forces personnel and others specified in the legislation - Allocation of Housing (Qualification Criteria for Armed Forces) (England) Regulations 2012 S.I 2012/1869 - will not have to meet any local connection criteria. These applications will be prioritised purely on housing need as laid down by our allocation policy. Therefore it is anticipated that, should the forces personal criteria be met as laid down in the Statutory Instrument, most applicants will be placed in Band C.</p><h2>Financial assessment</h2><p>If you have the financial means to purchase a property suitable for your needs, or to put right problems with your current home, you will normally be placed in band E2. You may, however, qualify for shared ownership properties.</p><h2>Deliberately worsening circumstances</h2><p>If there is evidence that you have deliberately worsened your circumstances in order to qualify for higher priority under the scheme, no additional priority will be given.</p>
